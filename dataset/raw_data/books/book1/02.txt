      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.
      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last
      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the
      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It
      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second
      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her
      with,

      â€œI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.â€

      â€œWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,â€ said her
      mother resentfully, â€œsince we are not to visit.â€

      â€œBut you forget, mamma,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œthat we shall meet him
      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.â€

      â€œI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two
      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I
      have no opinion of her.â€

      â€œNo more have I,â€ said Mr. Bennet; â€œand I am glad to find that
      you do not depend on her serving you.â€

      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

      â€œDonâ€™t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heavenâ€™s sake! Have a little
      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.â€

      â€œKitty has no discretion in her coughs,â€ said her father; â€œshe
      times them ill.â€

      â€œI do not cough for my own amusement,â€ replied Kitty fretfully.
      â€œWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?â€

      â€œTo-morrow fortnight.â€

      â€œAye, so it is,â€ cried her mother, â€œand Mrs. Long does not come
      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to
      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.â€

      â€œThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.â€

      â€œImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?â€

      â€œI honour your circumspection. A fortnightâ€™s acquaintance is
      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by
      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else
      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their
      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,
      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.â€

      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
      â€œNonsense, nonsense!â€

      â€œWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?â€ cried he.
      â€œDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that
      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you
      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep
      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.â€

      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

      â€œWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,â€ he continued, â€œlet us return
      to Mr. Bingley.â€

      â€œI am sick of Mr. Bingley,â€ cried his wife.

      â€œI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so
      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not
      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually
      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.â€

      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first
      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she
      had expected all the while.

      â€œHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is
      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and
      never said a word about it till now.â€

      â€œNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,â€ said Mr.
      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the
      raptures of his wife.

      â€œWhat an excellent father you have, girls,â€ said she, when the
      door was shut. â€œI do not know how you will ever make him amends
      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of
      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new
      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do
      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare
      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.â€

      â€œOh!â€ said Lydia stoutly, â€œI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
      youngest, Iâ€™m the tallest.â€

      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he
      would return Mr. Bennetâ€™s visit, and determining when they should
      ask him to dinner.
