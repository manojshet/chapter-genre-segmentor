      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisterâ€™s room, and
      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable
      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.
      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two
      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this
      amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to
      Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own
      judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,
      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,
      accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon
      after the family breakfast.

      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have
      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her
      illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering
      immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove
      her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her
      daughterâ€™s proposal of being carried home; neither did the
      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all
      advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
      Bingleyâ€™s appearance and invitation, the mother and three
      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley
      met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet
      worse than she expected.

      â€œIndeed I have, sir,â€ was her answer. â€œShe is a great deal too
      ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.
      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.â€

      â€œRemoved!â€ cried Bingley. â€œIt must not be thought of. My sister,
      I am sure, will not hear of her removal.â€

      â€œYou may depend upon it, Madam,â€ said Miss Bingley, with cold
      civility, â€œthat Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention
      while she remains with us.â€

      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

      â€œI am sure,â€ she added, â€œif it was not for such good friends I do
      not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,
      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the
      world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without
      exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell
      my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room
      here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.
      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
      hope, though you have but a short lease.â€

      â€œWhatever I do is done in a hurry,â€ replied he; â€œand therefore if
      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in
      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite
      fixed here.â€

      â€œThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,â€ said
      Elizabeth.

      â€œYou begin to comprehend me, do you?â€ cried he, turning towards
      her.

      â€œOh! yesâ€”I understand you perfectly.â€

      â€œI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
      seen through I am afraid is pitiful.â€

      â€œThat is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate
      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.â€

      â€œLizzy,â€ cried her mother, â€œremember where you are, and do not
      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.â€

      â€œI did not know before,â€ continued Bingley immediately, â€œthat you
      were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.â€

      â€œYes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have
      at least that advantage.â€

      â€œThe country,â€ said Darcy, â€œcan in general supply but few
      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in
      a very confined and unvarying society.â€

      â€œBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new
      to be observed in them for ever.â€

      â€œYes, indeed,â€ cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of
      mentioning a country neighbourhood. â€œI assure you there is quite
      as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.â€

      Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a
      moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had
      gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.

      â€œI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
      country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The
      country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?â€

      â€œWhen I am in the country,â€ he replied, â€œI never wish to leave
      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have
      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.â€

      â€œAyeâ€”that is because you have the right disposition. But that
      gentleman,â€ looking at Darcy, â€œseemed to think the country was
      nothing at all.â€

      â€œIndeed, Mama, you are mistaken,â€ said Elizabeth, blushing for
      her mother. â€œYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that
      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the
      country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.â€

      â€œCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there
      are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with
      four-and-twenty families.â€

      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep
      his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her
      eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,
      for the sake of saying something that might turn her motherâ€™s
      thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn
      since _her_ coming away.

      â€œYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man
      Sir William is, Mr. Bingleyâ€”is not he? so much the man of
      fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to
      everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons
      who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,
      quite mistake the matter.â€

      â€œDid Charlotte dine with you?â€

      â€œNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the
      mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants
      that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up
      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the
      Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity
      they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_
      plainâ€”but then she is our particular friend.â€

      â€œShe seems a very pleasant young woman,â€ said Bingley.

      â€œOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas
      herself has often said so, and envied me Janeâ€™s beauty. I do not
      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janeâ€”one does not
      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do
      not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was
      a gentleman at my brother Gardinerâ€™s in town so much in love with her,
      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before
      we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her
      too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty
      they were.â€

      â€œAnd so ended his affection,â€ said Elizabeth impatiently. â€œThere
      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away
      love!â€

      â€œI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,â€ said
      Darcy.

      â€œOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what
      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of
      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it
      entirely away.â€

      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made
      Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself
      again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;
      and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks
      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for
      troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil
      in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,
      and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed
      without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
      soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the
      youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had
      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the
      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with
      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a
      ball at Netherfield.

      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine
      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her
      mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early
      age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
      self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom
      her uncleâ€™s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended
      her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,
      to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly
      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to
      this sudden attack was delightful to their motherâ€™s ear.

      â€œI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and
      when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the
      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while
      she is ill.â€

      Lydia declared herself satisfied. â€œOh! yesâ€”it would be much
      better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely
      Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given
      _your_ ball,â€ she added, â€œI shall insist on their giving one
      also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he
      does not.â€

      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth
      returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relationsâ€™
      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the
      latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in
      their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingleyâ€™s witticisms
      on _fine eyes_.
