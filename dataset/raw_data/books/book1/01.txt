      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their
      daughters.

      â€œMy dear Mr. Bennet,â€ said his lady to him one day, â€œhave you
      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?â€

      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

      â€œBut it is,â€ returned she; â€œfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and
      she told me all about it.â€

      Mr. Bennet made no answer.

      â€œDo not you want to know who has taken it?â€ cried his wife
      impatiently.

      â€œ_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.â€

      This was invitation enough.

      â€œWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is
      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;
      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the
      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.
      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before
      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by
      the end of next week.â€

      â€œWhat is his name?â€

      â€œBingley.â€

      â€œIs he married or single?â€

      â€œOh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!â€

      â€œHow so? how can it affect them?â€

      â€œMy dear Mr. Bennet,â€ replied his wife, â€œhow can you be so
      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of
      them.â€

      â€œIs that his design in settling here?â€

      â€œDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely
      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you
      must visit him as soon as he comes.â€

      â€œI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may
      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for
      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you
      the best of the party.â€

      â€œMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of
      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.
      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over
      thinking of her own beauty.â€

      â€œIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.â€

      â€œBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he
      comes into the neighbourhood.â€

      â€œIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.â€

      â€œBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it
      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are
      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you
      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.â€

      â€œYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be
      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to
      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he
      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my
      little Lizzy.â€

      â€œI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better
      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as
      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always
      giving _her_ the preference.â€

      â€œThey have none of them much to recommend them,â€ replied he;
      â€œthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has
      something more of quickness than her sisters.â€

      â€œMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor
      nerves.â€

      â€œYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.
      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with
      consideration these twenty years at least.â€

      â€œAh, you do not know what I suffer.â€

      â€œBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men
      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.â€

      â€œIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you
      will not visit them.â€

      â€œDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will
      visit them all.â€

      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty
      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his
      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a
      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain
      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its
      solace was visiting and news.
