      Colonel Fitzwilliamâ€™s manners were very much admired at the
      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably
      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some
      days, however, before they received any invitation thitherâ€”for
      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be
      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after
      the gentlemenâ€™s arrival, that they were honoured by such an
      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very
      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had
      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.
      Darcy they had seen only at church.

      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they
      joined the party in Lady Catherineâ€™s drawing-room. Her ladyship
      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by
      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she
      was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,
      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the
      room.

      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was
      a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collinsâ€™s pretty
      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated
      himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and
      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books
      and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained
      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and
      flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well
      as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,
      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,
      for she did not scruple to call out:

      â€œWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are
      talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it
      is.â€

      â€œWe are speaking of music, madam,â€ said he, when no longer able
      to avoid a reply.

      â€œOf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my
      delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are
      speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,
      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better
      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great
      proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to
      apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?â€

      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisterâ€™s
      proficiency.

      â€œI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,â€ said Lady
      Catherine; â€œand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to
      excel if she does not practice a good deal.â€

      â€œI assure you, madam,â€ he replied, â€œthat she does not need such
      advice. She practises very constantly.â€

      â€œSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next
      write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any
      account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is
      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet
      several times, that she will never play really well unless she
      practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is
      very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every
      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinsonâ€™s room. She
      would be in nobodyâ€™s way, you know, in that part of the house.â€

      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his auntâ€™s ill-breeding, and
      made no answer.

      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of
      having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the
      instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to
      half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;
      till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual
      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to
      command a full view of the fair performerâ€™s countenance.
      Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient
      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

      â€œYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state
      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play
      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to
      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at
      every attempt to intimidate me.â€

      â€œI shall not say you are mistaken,â€ he replied, â€œbecause you
      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming
      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough
      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing
      opinions which in fact are not your own.â€

      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said
      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, â€œYour cousin will give you a very pretty
      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am
      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose
      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to
      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it
      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my
      disadvantage in Hertfordshireâ€”and, give me leave to say, very
      impolitic tooâ€”for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.â€

      â€œI am not afraid of you,â€ said he, smilingly.

      â€œPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,â€ cried Colonel
      Fitzwilliam. â€œI should like to know how he behaves among
      strangers.â€

      â€œYou shall hear thenâ€”but prepare yourself for something very
      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,
      you must know, was at a ballâ€”and at this ball, what do you think
      he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;
      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was
      sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the
      fact.â€

      â€œI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the
      assembly beyond my own party.â€

      â€œTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,
      Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your
      orders.â€

      â€œPerhaps,â€ said Darcy, â€œI should have judged better, had I sought
      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to
      strangers.â€

      â€œShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?â€ said Elizabeth,
      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. â€œShall we ask him why a man
      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill
      qualified to recommend himself to strangers?â€

      â€œI can answer your question,â€ said Fitzwilliam, â€œwithout applying
      to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.â€

      â€œI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,â€ said
      Darcy, â€œof conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
      I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested
      in their concerns, as I often see done.â€

      â€œMy fingers,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œdo not move over this instrument
      in the masterly manner which I see so many womenâ€™s do. They have
      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same
      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own
      faultâ€”because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is
      not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other
      womanâ€™s of superior execution.â€

      Darcy smiled and said, â€œYou are perfectly right. You have
      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege
      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us
      perform to strangers.â€

      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to
      know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began
      playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening
      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:

      â€œMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,
      and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very
      good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to
      Anneâ€™s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her
      health allowed her to learn.â€

      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
      cousinâ€™s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other
      could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his
      behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss
      Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,
      had she been his relation.

      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabethâ€™s performance,
      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
      Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,
      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument
      till her ladyshipâ€™s carriage was ready to take them all home.
