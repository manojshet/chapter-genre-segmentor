      â€œI hope, my dear,â€ said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
      breakfast the next morning, â€œthat you have ordered a good dinner
      to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family
      party.â€

      â€œWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am
      sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call inâ€”and I hope
      _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often
      sees such at home.â€

      â€œThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.â€

      Mrs. Bennetâ€™s eyes sparkled. â€œA gentleman and a stranger! It is
      Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad
      to see Mr. Bingley. Butâ€”good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a
      bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bellâ€”I
      must speak to Hill this moment.â€

      â€œIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,â€ said her husband; â€œit is a person whom
      I never saw in the whole course of my life.â€

      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of
      being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at
      once.

      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
      explained:

      â€œAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight
      ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and
      requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,
      who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon
      as he pleases.â€

      â€œOh! my dear,â€ cried his wife, â€œI cannot bear to hear that
      mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is
      the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be
      entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had
      been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other
      about it.â€

      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an
      entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a
      subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and
      she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an
      estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man
      whom nobody cared anything about.

      â€œIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,â€ said Mr. Bennet, â€œand
      nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting
      Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps
      be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.â€

      â€œNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very
      impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.
      I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling
      with you, as his father did before him?â€

      â€œWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on
      that head, as you will hear.â€

      â€œHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.

      â€œDear Sir,â€”
      â€œThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have
      had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal
      the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,
      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to
      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him
      to be at variance.â€”â€˜There, Mrs. Bennet.â€™â€”My mind, however, is now
      made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,
      I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage
      of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir
      Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to
      the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
      moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
      these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are
      highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in
      the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your
      side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I
      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring
      your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as
      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
      amendsâ€”but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
      receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of
      waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four
      oâ€™clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the
      Saturday seâ€™ennight following, which I can do without any
      inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my
      occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.â€”I remain, dear
      sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
      well-wisher and friend,

      â€œWILLIAM COLLINSâ€

      â€œAt four oâ€™clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making
      gentleman,â€ said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. â€œHe
      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my
      word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,
      especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him
      come to us again.â€

      â€œThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,
      and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the
      person to discourage him.â€

      â€œThough it is difficult,â€ said Jane, â€œto guess in what way he can
      mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is
      certainly to his credit.â€

      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for
      Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,
      and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.

      â€œHe must be an oddity, I think,â€ said she. â€œI cannot make him
      out.â€”There is something very pompous in his style.â€”And what can
      he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?â€”We cannot
      suppose he would help it if he could.â€”Could he be a sensible man,
      sir?â€

      â€œNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him
      quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and
      self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am
      impatient to see him.â€

      â€œIn point of composition,â€ said Mary, â€œthe letter does not seem
      defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly
      new, yet I think it is well expressed.â€

      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in
      any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their
      cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks
      since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any
      other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collinsâ€™s letter had done
      away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with
      a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.

      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;
      but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed
      neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent
      himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of
      five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners
      were very formal. He had not been long seated before he
      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;
      said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance
      fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
      doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.
      This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;
      but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most
      readily.

      â€œYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it
      may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are
      settled so oddly.â€

      â€œYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.â€

      â€œAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,
      you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for
      such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no
      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.â€

      â€œI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
      and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of
      appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young
      ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not
      say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquaintedâ€”â€

      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled
      on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collinsâ€™s
      admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,
      were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything
      would have touched Mrs. Bennetâ€™s heart, but for the mortifying
      supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The
      dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know
      to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was
      owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him
      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
      cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
      begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she
      declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to
      apologise for about a quarter of an hour.
