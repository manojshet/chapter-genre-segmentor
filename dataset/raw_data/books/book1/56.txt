      One morning, about a week after Bingleyâ€™s engagement with Jane
      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting
      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn
      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a
      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the
      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to
      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and
      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded
      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet
      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with
      him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of
      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,
      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was
      Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of
      Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,
      even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
      made no other reply to Elizabethâ€™s salutation than a slight
      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyshipâ€™s
      entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.

      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of
      such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.
      After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to
      Elizabeth,

      â€œI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
      mother.â€

      Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

      â€œAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.â€

      â€œYes, madam,â€ said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady
      Catherine. â€œShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all
      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,
      walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part
      of the family.â€

      â€œYou have a very small park here,â€ returned Lady Catherine after
      a short silence.

      â€œIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but
      I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucasâ€™s.â€

      â€œThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,
      in summer; the windows are full west.â€

      Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,
      and then added:

      â€œMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left
      Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.â€

      â€œYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.â€

      Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her
      from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her
      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take
      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not
      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,
      said to Elizabeth,

      â€œMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
      wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a
      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.â€

      â€œGo, my dear,â€ cried her mother, â€œand show her ladyship about the
      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.â€

      Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
      attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
      hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
      decent looking rooms, walked on.

      Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the
      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to
      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more
      than usually insolent and disagreeable.

      â€œHow could I ever think her like her nephew?â€ said she, as she
      looked in her face.

      As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the
      following manner:â€”

      â€œYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of
      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
      you why I come.â€

      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

      â€œIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to
      account for the honour of seeing you here.â€

      â€œMiss Bennet,â€ replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, â€œyou ought
      to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere
      _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character
      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in
      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from
      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I
      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most
      advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,
      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous
      falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose
      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for
      this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.â€

      â€œIf you believed it impossible to be true,â€ said Elizabeth,
      colouring with astonishment and disdain, â€œI wonder you took the
      trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by
      it?â€

      â€œAt once to insist upon having such a report universally
      contradicted.â€

      â€œYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,â€ said
      Elizabeth coolly, â€œwill be rather a confirmation of it; if,
      indeed, such a report is in existence.â€

      â€œIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such
      a report is spread abroad?â€

      â€œI never heard that it was.â€

      â€œAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for
      it?â€

      â€œI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
      _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.â€

      â€œThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being
      satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?â€

      â€œYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.â€

      â€œIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of
      his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of
      infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to
      all his family. You may have drawn him in.â€

      â€œIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.â€

      â€œMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to
      such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in
      the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.â€

      â€œBut you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour
      as this, ever induce me to be explicit.â€

      â€œLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy
      is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?â€

      â€œOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose
      he will make an offer to me.â€

      Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

      â€œThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their
      infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the
      favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in
      their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when
      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their
      marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of
      no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do
      you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit
      engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
      propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his
      earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?â€

      â€œYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there
      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall
      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt
      wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you
      could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on
      others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination
      confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And
      if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?â€

      â€œBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
      Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by
      his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the
      inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and
      despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a
      disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.â€

      â€œThese are heavy misfortunes,â€ replied Elizabeth. â€œBut the wife
      of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness
      necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the
      whole, have no cause to repine.â€

      â€œObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your
      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to
      me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss
      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of
      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not
      been used to submit to any personâ€™s whims. I have not been in the
      habit of brooking disappointment.â€

      â€œ_That_ will make your ladyshipâ€™s situation at present more
      pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.â€

      â€œI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and
      my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the
      maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the fatherâ€™s,
      from respectable, honourable, and ancientâ€”though
      untitledâ€”families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They
      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their
      respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart
      pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
      fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If
      you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit
      the sphere in which you have been brought up.â€

      â€œIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as
      quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemanâ€™s
      daughter; so far we are equal.â€

      â€œTrue. You _are_ a gentlemanâ€™s daughter. But who was your mother?
      Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of
      their condition.â€

      â€œWhatever my connections may be,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œif your nephew
      does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.â€

      â€œTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?â€

      Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
      Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,
      after a momentâ€™s deliberation:

      â€œI am not.â€

      Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

      â€œAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an
      engagement?â€

      â€œI will make no promise of the kind.â€

      â€œMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a
      more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a
      belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have
      given me the assurance I require.â€

      â€œAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be
      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship
      wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you
      the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more
      probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing
      to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
      Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which
      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
      frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely
      mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such
      persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your
      interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have
      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.â€

      â€œNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I
      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisterâ€™s
      infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young manâ€™s marrying
      her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and
      uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephewâ€™s sister? Is _her_
      husband, who is the son of his late fatherâ€™s steward, to be his
      brother? Heaven and earth!â€”of what are you thinking? Are the
      shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?â€

      â€œYou can _now_ have nothing further to say,â€ she resentfully
      answered. â€œYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must
      beg to return to the house.â€

      And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they
      turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

      â€œYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my
      nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a
      connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?â€

      â€œLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my
      sentiments.â€

      â€œYou are then resolved to have him?â€

      â€œI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that
      manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,
      without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly
      unconnected with me.â€

      â€œIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey
      the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to
      ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the
      contempt of the world.â€

      â€œNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,â€ replied Elizabeth,
      â€œhave any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No
      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.
      Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the
      indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his
      marrying me, it would not give me one momentâ€™s concernâ€”and the
      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.â€

      â€œAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very
      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,
      that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I
      hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry
      my point.â€

      In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the
      door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, â€œI
      take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
      mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously
      displeased.â€

      Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
      ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it
      herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up
      stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the
      dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again
      and rest herself.

      â€œShe did not choose it,â€ said her daughter, â€œshe would go.â€

      â€œShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was
      prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the
      Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,
      and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call
      on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,
      Lizzy?â€

      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
