      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been
      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable
      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to
      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been
      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business
      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting
      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile
      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled
      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the
      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.
      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation
      at St. Jamesâ€™s had made him courteous.

      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
      twenty-seven, was Elizabethâ€™s intimate friend.

      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to
      communicate.

      â€œ_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,â€ said Mrs. Bennet with
      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. â€œ_You_ were Mr. Bingleyâ€™s first
      choice.â€

      â€œYes; but he seemed to like his second better.â€

      â€œOh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.
      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herâ€”indeed I rather
      believe he _did_â€”I heard something about itâ€”but I hardly know
      whatâ€”something about Mr. Robinson.â€

      â€œPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;
      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsonâ€™s asking him how he
      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there
      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he
      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last
      questionâ€”â€˜Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there
      cannot be two opinions on that point.â€™â€

      â€œUpon my word! Well, that was very decided indeedâ€”that does seem
      as ifâ€”but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.â€

      â€œ_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,â€
      said Charlotte. â€œMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as
      his friend, is he?â€”Poor Eliza!â€”to be only just _tolerable_.â€

      â€œI beg you would not put it into Lizzyâ€™s head to be vexed by his
      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would
      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last
      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once
      opening his lips.â€

      â€œAre you quite sure, maâ€™am?â€”is not there a little mistake?â€ said
      Jane. â€œI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.â€

      â€œAyeâ€”because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very
      angry at being spoke to.â€

      â€œMiss Bingley told me,â€ said Jane, â€œthat he never speaks much
      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is
      remarkably agreeable.â€

      â€œI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how
      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare
      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,
      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.â€

      â€œI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,â€ said Miss Lucas,
      â€œbut I wish he had danced with Eliza.â€

      â€œAnother time, Lizzy,â€ said her mother, â€œI would not dance with
      _him_, if I were you.â€

      â€œI believe, maâ€™am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with
      him.â€

      â€œHis pride,â€ said Miss Lucas, â€œdoes not offend _me_ so much as
      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,
      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I
      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.â€

      â€œThat is very true,â€ replied Elizabeth, â€œand I could easily
      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.â€

      â€œPride,â€ observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
      her reflections, â€œis a very common failing, I believe. By all
      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common
      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that
      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or
      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the
      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without
      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,
      vanity to what we would have others think of us.â€

      â€œIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,â€ cried a young Lucas, who came
      with his sisters, â€œI should not care how proud I was. I would
      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.â€

      â€œThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,â€ said
      Mrs. Bennet; â€œand if I were to see you at it, I should take away
      your bottle directly.â€

      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare
      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
