      Mr. Bennetâ€™s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of
      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was
      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and
      their motherâ€™s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,
      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been
      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.

      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk
      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother
      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to
      their aunt and to a millinerâ€™s shop just over the way. The two
      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly
      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than
      their sistersâ€™, and when nothing better offered, a walk to
      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the
      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia
      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,
      and Meryton was the headquarters.

      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most
      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their
      knowledge of the officersâ€™ names and connections. Their lodgings
      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this
      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They
      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingleyâ€™s large
      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an
      ensign.

      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,
      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,

      â€œFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must
      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it
      some time, but I am now convinced.â€

      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with
      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of
      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the
      day, as he was going the next morning to London.

      â€œI am astonished, my dear,â€ said Mrs. Bennet, â€œthat you should be
      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
      slightingly of anybodyâ€™s children, it should not be of my own,
      however.â€

      â€œIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of
      it.â€

      â€œYesâ€”but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.â€

      â€œThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not
      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every
      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.â€

      â€œMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I
      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.
      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very wellâ€”and,
      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I
      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked
      very becoming the other night at Sir Williamâ€™s in his
      regimentals.â€

      â€œMamma,â€ cried Lydia, â€œmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and
      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsonâ€™s as they did
      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in
      Clarkeâ€™s library.â€

      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman
      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the
      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennetâ€™s eyes sparkled with
      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter
      read,

      â€œWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?
      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.â€

      â€œIt is from Miss Bingley,â€ said Jane, and then read it aloud.

      â€œMY DEAR FRIEND,â€”
      â€œIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa
      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest
      of our lives, for a whole dayâ€™s _tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte_ between two women
      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the
      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with
      the officers.â€”Yours ever,

      â€œCAROLINE BINGLEYâ€

      â€œWith the officers!â€ cried Lydia. â€œI wonder my aunt did not tell
      us of _that_.â€

      â€œDining out,â€ said Mrs. Bennet, â€œthat is very unlucky.â€

      â€œCan I have the carriage?â€ said Jane.

      â€œNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.â€

      â€œThat would be a good scheme,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œif you were sure
      that they would not offer to send her home.â€

      â€œOh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingleyâ€™s chaise to go to
      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.â€

      â€œI had much rather go in the coach.â€

      â€œBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.
      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?â€

      â€œThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.â€

      â€œBut if you have got them to-day,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œmy motherâ€™s
      purpose will be answered.â€

      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the
      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on
      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many
      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane
      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were
      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued
      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not
      come back.

      â€œThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!â€ said Mrs. Bennet, more
      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.
      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the
      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a
      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for
      Elizabeth:

      â€œMY DEAREST LIZZY,â€”
      â€œI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to
      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends
      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also
      on my seeing Mr. Jonesâ€”therefore do not be alarmed if you should
      hear of his having been to meâ€”and, excepting a sore throat and
      headache, there is not much the matter with me.â€”Yours, &c.â€

      â€œWell, my dear,â€ said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the
      note aloud, â€œif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of
      illnessâ€”if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it
      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.â€

      â€œOh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she
      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I
      could have the carriage.â€

      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,
      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no
      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her
      resolution.

      â€œHow can you be so silly,â€ cried her mother, â€œas to think of such
      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when
      you get there.â€

      â€œI shall be very fit to see Janeâ€”which is all I want.â€

      â€œIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,â€ said her father, â€œto send for the
      horses?â€

      â€œNo, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is
      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back
      by dinner.â€

      â€œI admire the activity of your benevolence,â€ observed Mary, â€œbut
      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my
      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is
      required.â€

      â€œWe will go as far as Meryton with you,â€ said Catherine and
      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young
      ladies set off together.

      â€œIf we make haste,â€ said Lydia, as they walked along, â€œperhaps we
      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.â€

      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings
      of one of the officersâ€™ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk
      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over
      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and
      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary
      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of
      exercise.

      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the
      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible
      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that
      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very
      politely by them; and in their brotherâ€™s manners there was
      something better than politeness; there was good humour and
      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at
      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy
      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the
      occasionâ€™s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
      thinking only of his breakfast.

      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and
      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken
      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the
      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note
      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her
      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and
      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little
      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness
      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.

      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and
      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much
      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary
      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be
      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must
      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,
      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,
      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.
      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other
      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
      nothing to do elsewhere.

      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and
      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,
      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane
      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was
      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to
      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully
      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint
      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.
