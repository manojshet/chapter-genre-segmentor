      â€œMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?â€ was a
      question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she
      entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to
      table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered
      about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she
      spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion
      of the truth.

      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged
      were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness
      overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather
      _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,
      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils
      before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when
      her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him
      but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_
      which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very
      far from Miss Bennetâ€™s general habits, she was absolutely
      incredulous here.

      â€œYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!â€”engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,
      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.â€

      â€œThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on
      you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
      Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He
      still loves me, and we are engaged.â€

      Jane looked at her doubtingly. â€œOh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know
      how much you dislike him.â€

      â€œYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.
      Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in
      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the
      last time I shall ever remember it myself.â€

      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
      seriously assured her of its truth.

      â€œGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,â€
      cried Jane. â€œMy dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldâ€”I do congratulate
      youâ€”but are you certain? forgive the questionâ€”are you quite
      certain that you can be happy with him?â€

      â€œThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,
      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you
      pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?â€

      â€œVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself
      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as
      impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,
      Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you
      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?â€

      â€œOh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,
      when I tell you all.â€

      â€œWhat do you mean?â€

      â€œWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I
      am afraid you will be angry.â€

      â€œMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very
      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without
      delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?â€

      â€œIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his
      beautiful grounds at Pemberley.â€

      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
      desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn
      assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss
      Bennet had nothing further to wish.

      â€œNow I am quite happy,â€ said she, â€œfor you will be as happy as
      myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his
      love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as
      Bingleyâ€™s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and
      yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very
      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at
      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,
      not to you.â€

      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been
      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own
      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But
      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydiaâ€™s
      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in
      conversation.

      â€œGood gracious!â€ cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the
      next morning, â€œif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here
      again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so
      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he
      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us
      with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk
      out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleyâ€™s way.â€

      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;
      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him
      such an epithet.

      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,
      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good
      information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, â€œMrs. Bennet,
      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way
      again to-day?â€

      â€œI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,â€ said Mrs. Bennet, â€œto
      walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and
      Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.â€

      â€œIt may do very well for the others,â€ replied Mr. Bingley; â€œbut I
      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wonâ€™t it, Kitty?â€ Kitty
      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
      consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet
      followed her, saying:

      â€œI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind
      it: it is all for Janeâ€™s sake, you know; and there is no occasion
      for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put
      yourself to inconvenience.â€

      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennetâ€™s consent
      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved
      to herself the application for her motherâ€™s. She could not
      determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting
      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome
      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set
      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain
      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her
      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
      first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
      disapprobation.

      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,
      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on
      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her fatherâ€™s opposition,
      but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be
      through her meansâ€”that _she_, his favourite child, should be
      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears
      and regrets in disposing of herâ€”was a wretched reflection, and
      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at
      him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he
      approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, â€œGo to your
      father, he wants you in the library.â€ She was gone directly.

      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
      â€œLizzy,â€ said he, â€œwhat are you doing? Are you out of your
      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?â€

      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been
      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have
      spared her from explanations and professions which it was
      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she
      assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

      â€œOr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,
      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages
      than Jane. But will they make you happy?â€

      â€œHave you any other objection,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œthan your belief
      of my indifference?â€

      â€œNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of
      man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.â€

      â€œI do, I do like him,â€ she replied, with tears in her eyes, â€œI
      love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly
      amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain
      me by speaking of him in such terms.â€

      â€œLizzy,â€ said her father, â€œI have given him my consent. He is the
      kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,
      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are
      resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of
      it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be
      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your
      husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively
      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal
      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My
      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to
      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.â€

      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her
      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was
      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change
      which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute
      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had
      stood the test of many monthsâ€™ suspense, and enumerating with
      energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her fatherâ€™s
      incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

      â€œWell, my dear,â€ said he, when she ceased speaking, â€œI have no
      more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not
      have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.â€

      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.
      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with
      astonishment.

      â€œThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every
      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellowâ€™s
      debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will
      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncleâ€™s
      doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young
      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him
      to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and
      there will be an end of the matter.â€

      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his
      reading Mr. Collinsâ€™s letter; and after laughing at her some
      time, allowed her at last to goâ€”saying, as she quitted the room,
      â€œIf any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am
      quite at leisure.â€

      Elizabethâ€™s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,
      after half an hourâ€™s quiet reflection in her own room, she was
      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was
      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;
      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the
      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.

      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she
      followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect
      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat
      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under
      many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;
      though not in general backward to credit what was for the
      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to
      any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
      her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

      â€œGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!
      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest
      Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what
      jewels, what carriages you will have! Janeâ€™s is nothing to
      itâ€”nothing at all. I am so pleasedâ€”so happy. Such a charming
      man!â€”so handsome! so tall!â€”Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for
      my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook
      it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is
      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!
      What will become of me. I shall go distracted.â€

      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be
      doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard
      only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three
      minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.

      â€œMy dearest child,â€ she cried, â€œI can think of nothing else! Ten
      thousand a year, and very likely more! â€™Tis as good as a Lord!
      And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special
      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is
      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.â€

      This was a sad omen of what her motherâ€™s behaviour to the
      gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in
      the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of
      her relationsâ€™ consent, there was still something to be wished
      for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for
      Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law
      that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power
      to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his
      opinion.

      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains
      to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that
      he was rising every hour in his esteem.

      â€œI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,â€ said he. â€œWickham,
      perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband
      quite as well as Janeâ€™s.â€
