      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
      sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into
      the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with
      many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them
      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the
      gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were
      considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,
      relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance
      with spirit.

      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first
      object; Miss Bingleyâ€™s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,
      and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many
      steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite
      congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he
      was â€œvery glad;â€ but diffuseness and warmth remained for
      Bingleyâ€™s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first
      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer
      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the
      other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the
      door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
      else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with
      great delight.

      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
      card-tableâ€”but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence
      that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found
      even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one
      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the
      subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to
      do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,
      joined now and then in her brotherâ€™s conversation with Miss
      Bennet.

      Miss Bingleyâ€™s attention was quite as much engaged in watching
      Mr. Darcyâ€™s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;
      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at
      his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he
      merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite
      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which
      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she
      gave a great yawn and said, â€œHow pleasant it is to spend an
      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment
      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I
      have not an excellent library.â€

      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her
      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some
      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss
      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:

      â€œBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a
      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on
      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much
      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be
      rather a punishment than a pleasure.â€

      â€œIf you mean Darcy,â€ cried her brother, â€œhe may go to bed, if he
      chooses, before it beginsâ€”but as for the ball, it is quite a
      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup
      enough, I shall send round my cards.â€

      â€œI should like balls infinitely better,â€ she replied, â€œif they
      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It
      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of
      dancing were made the order of the day.â€

      â€œMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would
      not be near so much like a ball.â€

      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and
      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked
      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly
      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one
      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:

      â€œMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and
      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing
      after sitting so long in one attitude.â€

      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss
      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.
      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention
      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously
      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but
      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives
      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with
      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. â€œWhat
      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
      meaning?â€â€”and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
      him?

      â€œNot at all,â€ was her answer; â€œbut depend upon it, he means to be
      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to
      ask nothing about it.â€

      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy
      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation
      of his two motives.

      â€œI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,â€ said he,
      as soon as she allowed him to speak. â€œYou either choose this
      method of passing the evening because you are in each otherâ€™s
      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you
      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage
      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and
      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the
      fire.â€

      â€œOh! shocking!â€ cried Miss Bingley. â€œI never heard anything so
      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?â€

      â€œNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,â€ said
      Elizabeth. â€œWe can all plague and punish one another. Tease
      himâ€”laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to
      be done.â€

      â€œBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy
      has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and
      presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to
      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by
      attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug
      himself.â€

      â€œMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!â€ cried Elizabeth. â€œThat is an
      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it
      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I
      dearly love a laugh.â€

      â€œMiss Bingley,â€ said he, â€œhas given me more credit than can be.
      The wisest and the best of menâ€”nay, the wisest and best of their
      actionsâ€”may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object
      in life is a joke.â€

      â€œCertainly,â€ replied Elizabethâ€”â€œthere are such people, but I hope
      I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and
      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_
      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,
      I suppose, are precisely what you are without.â€

      â€œPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the
      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a
      strong understanding to ridicule.â€

      â€œSuch as vanity and pride.â€

      â€œYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But prideâ€”where there is a
      real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
      regulation.â€

      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

      â€œYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,â€ said Miss
      Bingley; â€œand pray what is the result?â€

      â€œI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He
      owns it himself without disguise.â€

      â€œNo,â€ said Darcy, â€œI have made no such pretension. I have faults
      enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I
      dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little
      yieldingâ€”certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I
      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,
      nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed
      about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be
      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.â€

      â€œ_That_ is a failing indeed!â€ cried Elizabeth. â€œImplacable
      resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your
      fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.â€

      â€œThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
      particular evilâ€”a natural defect, which not even the best
      education can overcome.â€

      â€œAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.â€

      â€œAnd yours,â€ he replied with a smile, â€œis willfully to
      misunderstand them.â€

      â€œDo let us have a little music,â€ cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
      conversation in which she had no share. â€œLouisa, you will not
      mind my waking Mr. Hurst?â€

      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
      opened; and Darcy, after a few momentsâ€™ recollection, was not
      sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too
      much attention.
