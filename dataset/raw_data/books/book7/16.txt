Rapid thoughts were revolving in his mind:

â€œI will take her far away from New York, my precious daughter, and her
mother shall never know that she is not lying in the old vault among
her dead-and-gone kindred, the proud Van Dorns. The rest of her sweet
life shall belong to the plebian father her mother despised.â€

Suddenly he remembered the old sexton lying, as he supposed, in a heavy
swoon on the floor of the vault.

â€œCan I purchase his silence?â€ he wondered, laying Jessieâ€™s quiet form
down on the dry grass while he returned to the vault.

It gave him a shock to find that the old man was quite dead, but
directly he began to perceive that the sudden death would help his
plans materially.

â€œPoor old man, I am very sorry about it, but it makes my secret safe.
Now, I will lay him with the lantern and the vault keys some distance
away in one of the paths, so that when he is found in the morning no
one will suspect what has happened here,â€ he thought, as he lifted the
frame of the old man and bore it some distance away, placing beside it
the lantern and keys as if he had fallen dead on the spot.

â€œGod rest his soul!â€ he murmured, bending over the still form and
placing in his inner coat pocket a sum of money more than sufficient to
defray his burial expenses.

â€œFor who knows but he may have left a widow and orphans who will mourn
bitterly to-morrow when he is found here dead,â€ he thought, with a
sigh, as he turned from the spot, returning to Jessie, who lay faintly
breathing, but not yet fully conscious, on the grass.

â€œNow to get safely away from here before she awakes and realizes the
horror of her position,â€ he muttered, fastening the long overcoat
tightly around her to conceal her white robes as he bore her in his
arms out of the beautiful cemetery, past glimmering statues marking the
last repose of world-worn hearts.

  The mossy marbles rest
  On the lips that we have pressed
    In their bloom.
  And the names we loved to hear
  Have been carved for many a year
    On the tomb.

Once safely in the street, he ventured to call a taxicab, explaining to
the chauffeur, who looked suspiciously at his strange burden, that his
daughter had fainted in the street while they were on their way to a
little party.

â€œJust drive about the streets a while until I give you further orders,â€
he said, wishing to gain time to think.

To carry Jessie in this garb and condition to any hotel, he knew, would
bring upon him a suspicion he was unwilling to face, so he racked his
brain in the endeavor to decide where to go with his charge.

In his extremity he thought of the woman by whom the Lyndons had once
lived, and who had told him of his sisterâ€™s death and the removal
of the bereaved family to so distant a part of the city that she had
quite lost track of them. The woman was widowed and lived alone in a
poor cottage of her own, so it was the safest refuge he could find for
Jessie.

To this kindly soul he went in his trouble, and was received with
motherly cordiality.

Preferring not to tell her the actual truth, he satisfied her curiosity
with a plausible story, and soon had Jessie disrobed and placed in a
warm, comfortable bed.

But though the woman who had dearly loved Jessie always called her by
every fond, endearing name, no light of recognition shone in the dazed,
dark eyes. By morning they found that she was really ill, and needed a
physician.

â€œShe has had a fall and perhaps injured her brain--however, I can tell
better by to-morrow,â€ said the man of healing.

Acting on this clever diagnosis, his treatment of the case was so
correct that within three days the light of reason returned to Jessieâ€™s
eyes.

It was a fact that the fall on the pavement and striking her head had
more seriously injured Jessie than the drug she had taken, the latter
having only induced a long, deep sleep, very like its â€œtwin brother
death.â€

Leon Dalrymple watched by her bedside with passionate devotion, feeling
that he had at last something to live for in this beautiful daughter
restored to him as from the dead.

While she still lay ill without having recognized any one around her,
he provided the Widow Doyle with a full purse and sent her out to buy a
fine outfit.

â€œWe are going away on a journey, my daughter and I,â€ he said. â€œShe must
have a large trunkful of good clothing suitable to a young lady of
moderate fortune--nothing gaudy or cheap, but of fine material, and of
the best make.â€

Mrs. Doyle was a woman of excellent taste, and she fitted Jessie out
well with clothing of the best style, so that when she was well enough
to sit up she could while away the hours of convalescence by admiring
her pretty, new things.

The day came when she opened wide her beautiful eyes with the light
of reason shining in them, and saw sitting by the bed a handsome,
fair-haired man, who had about him a subtle fascination that instantly
drew her heart.

â€œWho are you?â€ she whispered faintly.

He turned and took her hand.

â€œHave you never heard of your absent father, dear little Jessie?â€

â€œYes. Are you----â€

â€œYes, I am your father, dearest. Will you kiss me?â€

She held up her sweet face passively and gave him a childâ€™s dutiful
kiss, murmuring plaintively:

â€œAnd my mother?â€

A dark frown gloomed his brow as he retorted angrily:

â€œWe will never speak of her, Jessie. She is as one dead to us both.â€
