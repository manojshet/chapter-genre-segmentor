In less than half an hour after Mrs. Hiltonâ€™s cry had alarmed the
ladies and gentlemen assembled to do honor to Isabel Hilton in this
celebration of her birthday, the house was cleared of every guest with
the exception of Grace and Chester St. John.

â€œGo home, dear, and trust me to take care of Iris as if she were indeed
your sister,â€ Chester had said to Grace; but pretty Grace had answered
with a decision and dignity quite new to her:

â€œNo, Chester; you believed that Iris was guilty--you were false to her
when she most needed a true friend; but I could never doubt her, and I
shall stay beside her now to give help and what comfort I may in the
trial I see before her.â€

â€œGod bless you for your faith in her, my sweet sister!â€ answered
Chester huskily, as he laid the trembling form of Iris out of his arms,
back into the chair from which she had arisen, ere he hurried from the
house to bring the doctor to Mrs. Hilton.

While he was absent on this errand, Isabel, who realized, with a
sickening sense of desolation and misery, that St. John was lost to her
forever, escaped to her own apartments, where she locked herself in,
refusing to admit even her maid until the afternoon of the following
day.

St. John returned with a doctor in less than fifteen minutes. Mrs.
Hilton was still in convulsions, and the physician saw at a glance
that her case was hopeless.

He gave his decision promptly and without any unnecessary beating
around the bush.

â€œI will do all that is possible to relieve your wifeâ€™s sufferings, Mr.
Hilton, but it is beyond the power of mortal skill to save her. She may
linger with intervals of consciousness for several days, and she may
pass away before daylight; but in any case I have not the faintest hope
of her recovery.â€

Mr. Hilton groaned aloud at these words, while Iris wept bitterly.

The latter had not entirely lost consciousness, but that sickening
feeling of weakness robbed her limbs of their strength, and she could
not for her life have arisen from the chair in which Chester had placed
her, until nearly an hour had passed, and Chester and Grace were
preparing to take their departure.

Mrs. Hilton had been carried upstairs to her own apartments, but Mr.
Hilton still lingered, waiting in an agony of impatience for the St.
Johns to leave the house.

Iris scarcely heard Graceâ€™s words of farewell, but every tone of
Chesterâ€™s voice thrilled her heart to its inmost core, as he bent over
her chair and clasped both her hands in his own.

â€œIris, there has been treachery and deceit at work--and through my
belief in your guilt I have lost you. Oh, this is killing me!â€

He had crushed her passive hands so tightly in his agony and regret
that she with difficulty repressed a cry of pain, and then he
hurriedly left the room, murmuring as he threw himself back among the
car cushions by his sisterâ€™s side:

â€œOh, if I had only trusted her, but my hand was the first to fling a
stone at her memory, my heart the first to fail in its allegiance, and
now I am pledged to another, and she----â€

He could no longer carry out this bitter train of thought, it almost
maddened him to think of Iris as he had left her, remaining on
sufferance in the home from which she was an outcast, and where her
mother lay dying.

After his departure Iris grew stronger, and, clasping Oscar Hiltonâ€™s
hand in passionate pleading, begged to be allowed to nurse her mother
until the end.

â€œOh, sir, please do not refuse me--I will intrude not one hour
after--after all is over,â€ she sobbed, and, broken and weakened by the
shock of this sudden calamity, Mr. Hilton reluctantly consented for
her to stay, and a few moments later Iris took her position beside her
unconscious motherâ€™s bed, prepared to do her duty faithfully to the
end, although she knew now that this motherâ€™s hand had doomed her to
all the sorrow she had been forced to endure.

Toward noon on the following day Evelyn Hilton recovered consciousness,
and, on recognizing her daughter, appeared much pleased, and sank into
a heavy slumber, after whispering a few words which were heard by Iris
alone.

â€œI will tell you everything, my daughter, when I wake, and you must try
to forgive me.â€

But, alas! before she again awakened, the greatest trial of Irisâ€™ life
had come to her, and the motherâ€™s eyes were doomed to look no more on
her childâ€™s face on this side of the grave.

As early as was at all consistent with the rules of etiquette St. John
and Grace called to inquire for the sufferer.

Isabel received them, looking unusually handsome in her bright, crimson
morning robe, with all the rich color faded out of her dark face, and
her lips quivering piteously as she reported that dear mamma was not
any better, and that she--Isabel--was forced to stay out of the sick
room because she could not listen to poor mammaâ€™s wild and improbable
fancies.

Grace understood the yearning look in her brotherâ€™s eyes, and proffered
a timid request for a word with Iris; but Isabel declared that Iris
could not be induced to leave her motherâ€™s bedside for a moment, and
the visitors could not persist any further.

During their brief stay she found an opportunity of speaking alone with
Chester.

â€œThis is a cruel trial, dear Chester; I long to hear some words of
sympathy from your lips; I have sore need of your love now; it is all
so lonesome and terrible with papa always in the sick room, and the
house silent as the grave.â€

She had clasped her small hands on his shoulder, and bent her head upon
them, so that her face was very near his own; but although Chester
smoothed her dark, glossy hair with a gentle touch, he did not give
her the caress she expected, for between them there arose a vision
he could not banish--the vision of a sweet mignonne face, a pair of
limpid, violet eyes, and a pretty, bright-tressed head that he had
lately seen bowed in bitter sorrow.

The struggle going on within his heart was almost maddening. Could
he, with his chivalrous sense of honor, ask this girl, who had openly
confessed her love for him, to release him from his promise, that he
might devote his life to the clearing of Iris Tresilianâ€™s name, and
afterward to the task of winning Irisâ€™ forgiveness for having doubted
her?

His conscience told him his first duty was to the woman who was his
promised wife, and for the first time in his life he found it hard to
obey this silent, inward voice.

While he was taking his leave of Isabel a loud ring at the doorbell
startled them, and his heart throbbed with an unaccountable feeling of
foreboding.

Grace was already in the vestibule, and opened the door before a
servant had time to answer the summons. Two men stood on the doorstep,
one of whom exclaimed, without preface:

â€œWe are looking for a girl whose name, we believe, is Aris, or Iris
Tresilian, but who calls herself Maggie Gordon.â€

While speaking the man had coolly unbuttoned his coat and exhibited a
shining shield, at sight of which Grace uttered a cry of terror, and
clung to her brotherâ€™s arm, trembling in every limb.

â€œGreat heavens! There is some terrible mistake,â€ ejaculated Chester,
asking, as the men came across the threshold: â€œWith what do you
charge Iris Tresilian?â€ to which the man replied in his usual cool,
matter-of-fact tone:

â€œWith the theft of two hundred dollars. Madam Marie Ward, of
Forty-first Street, is her accuser.â€
