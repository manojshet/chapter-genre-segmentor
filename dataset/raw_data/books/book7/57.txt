It never occurred to Iris to attempt an escape from Mrs. Nevilleâ€™s
boudoir, until such time as Broughton saw fit to release her.

At ten oâ€™clock that night Broughton reÃ«ntered the room.

â€œWell, have you concluded to accept my offer?â€ he asked sternly, and
the sound of his voice had the effect of rousing the girl as nothing
else could have done.

â€œI shall never accept your offer. Let me go, sir; I had rather be
thrown into prison for a theft of which I am innocent than buy my
freedom at such a price.â€

â€œIt will be a noble revenge, my dear, to doom the child of my betrayer
to the same fate I suffered at her hands. Go, now, it is after ten
oâ€™clock, and Madam Ward will be terribly alarmed, you know.â€

He moved aside for Iris to pass out as he concluded, and the girl went
out into the street alone, knowing it would be useless to appeal to him
again or to demand the return of madamâ€™s money.

â€œOh, what shall I do! I dare not face Madam Ward, nor can I go to
Jenny; it would kill me to see a look of distrust in the eyes of
the girl who has loved and trusted me always, and who is now my
only friend. Father in heaven, look down on Thy most wretched child
to-night, and direct her what to do; guide her to some haven of refuge,
or she will die in the streets.â€

She finally determined to go home to her mother.

Her hand was on the bell knob of the door of her home when the most
cruel memory that had yet dawned upon her made her pause in the act
of ringing. Chester St. John was surely in those lighted parlors--an
honored guest, and the betrothed husband of Isabel, while she, whom he
once loved, was an outcast and homeless, alone in the darkness of the
night and the storm.

This bitter memory was as the last straw that broke the camelâ€™s back,
and when Peter opened the door, her lips could frame no other word than
that piteous cry for â€œmotherâ€ ere the tortured brain once more gave way.

She did not faint, or entirely lose consciousness, but a deadly
sickness robbed her limbs of their strength, and Peter was obliged to
lift her into a little room across the hallway, ere he went to acquaint
Mr. Hilton with the fact of her presence.

Iris would have made her own way to her motherâ€™s apartments when he had
departed on this mission, but it seemed that her limbs were palsied,
and refused to obey her will, or even to bear her slight weight when
she made an attempt to stand on her feet.

â€œWas it death that was coming to her?â€

A happy light sprang into her weary eyes as this sweet hope dawned upon
her, and she murmured in a tone loud enough to reach the ears of Mr.
Hilton, who had just entered the room:

â€œMother, you will let me stay with you till it is over; you will not
turn your child out into the streets to die?â€

â€œGood heavens, girl! Why do you talk of dying? You are raving; what has
happened to you, and why are you here?â€

The last words, harshly and coldly spoken, showed the girl that she had
little mercy to expect at the hands of her motherâ€™s husband.

â€œLet me see my mother--I am ill--dying, I think--and I--I have no one
else in all the world,â€ she said faintly, holding to the back of a
chair for support as she arose from the couch on which Peter had laid
her.

â€œI cannot grant your request, Iris,â€ he said coldly. â€œBy your own
conduct you have forfeited your right to hold any manner of intercourse
with my wife. If you are ill I will give you some money, and send
Peter to take you to your lodgings, but this is all I can promise--ah,
Isabel, my daughter, why did you follow me here? Go back to your
guests.â€

The bright head of Iris had drooped lower and lower while Hilton spoke
until it rested on the back of the chair, but as he addressed Isabel,
she--Iris--raised her eyes, with the vague hope that the girl whom she
had loved as a sister would say some word in her favor.

â€œIsabel, I have only asked to see my mother,â€ she faltered, but Isabel
retorted coldly:

â€œI fully agree with papa that it is impossible. How could you come
here to-night, Iris, when you know how the world is talking of your
disgraceful conduct. You must go away quietly----â€

â€œIsabel!â€

The voice that had spoken the name proceeded from the doorway, where
Chester St. John was standing, gazing into the room with eyes that
were dark with scorn and anger, and a face white as that of Iris
herself.

â€œChester,â€ Isabel exclaimed, with an air of injured innocence and a
reproachful glance toward the motionless figure in the doorway, â€œyou
think we are cruel and harsh to Iris; but you cannot understand that in
denying her request to-night we were seeking to spare her the bitter
knowledge that her own mother absolutely refuses to admit her, or to
speak to her if she were dying. Is not this the truth, papa?â€

â€œIt is certainly true, St. John,â€ he answered. â€œI would have spared
this unfortunate girl, had such a thing been at all possible; but my
wife positively declines to have anything to do with her daughter now,
or at any time in the future. Mrs. Hilton is even weaker to-night
than usual, and--but,â€ with a sudden assumption of pride and offended
dignity, â€œI do not really know why I am making these explanations to
you, St. John; as my daughterâ€™s accepted suitor, the affairs of this
girl cannot concern you; and I think you will do me the justice to
confess that I, who have fed and clothed and sheltered Iris Tresilian
until she left my home of her own accord, and for what purpose you
know--am fully capable of dealing justly with her now.â€

â€œI understand your reproof, sir, and while I acknowledge that I have no
right to dictate to you in this matter, I will still beg leave to say a
word in the interests of common humanity. Had I never looked upon Iris
Tresilianâ€™s face I should still protest against a young creature like
her being sent out on such a night, unprotected and alone. If she has
sinned----â€

At the last words of St. John, â€œIf she has sinned,â€ spoken in a
sorrowful tone that told how firmly he believed in her guilt, all
her soul seemed to rise in passionate rebellion, and with the false
strength despair sometimes lends, Iris advanced toward the group
near the doorway, and stood before them, a little, solitary figure,
with white, set features, whose immobility would have been actually
startling but for the convulsive twitching of the muscles of the
colorless lips, and the large, blue eyes dilated like those of a hunted
stag.

â€œOf what sin am I accused, Mr. Hilton?â€ she asked. â€œFor what crime does
my mother condemn me so harshly?â€ Then turning suddenly to St. John,
before Hilton could answer: â€œI left this gentlemanâ€™s home because he
taught me that I had no claim upon him--that I, who had believed myself
his daughter, was the child of an unworthy father whose name I should
blush to bear. I went forth from this house to earn my own bread, and
since that time I have done nothing of which I need be ashamed, nor----â€

She came to a sudden stop here, while for a moment the color grew
deeper and deeper in her face, and then faded utterly, leaving her
again deadly pale.

She had thought of Gerald Dareâ€™s words, and the suspicions her presence
in the house of Charles Broughton had awakened.

Her sudden hesitation and confusion, and the ineradicable flush
of shame that had dyed her cheeks at this cruel memory, seemed to
contradict her previous assertion of innocence, and to shake the faith
new-born in Chester St. Johnâ€™s heart.

At Irisâ€™ first words Oscar Hilton had trembled lest there should
be something said concerning the forged letter, and he now seized
this moment of the girlâ€™s embarrassment to turn the drift of the
conversation into a new channel.

â€œMy poor child,â€ he ejaculated, in a tone of well-feigned sympathy,
â€œdo not seek to defend your conduct. Unhappily we have all been made
acquainted with the manner in which you have passed your time since
leaving my protection. If--as you say--you are innocent, will you be
good enough to tell us what you are to the noted gambler and rouÃ©,
Charles Broughton?â€

At this coarse and rude question Iris started violently, and looked
into the face of the speaker with an expression of actual terror,
fearing for the moment that he had in some manner learned the secret of
Broughtonâ€™s identity.

That one swift glance into his eyes reassured her. She knew that he
shared, or pretended to share, the common belief that Broughton was her
lover, and she dared say nothing to undeceive him.

â€œI can tell you nothing at present, but some time you will know all,
and learn how deeply you have wronged me. My mother will forgive me
then, and bitterly regret her cruelty.â€

She took a step toward the door as she concluded, keeping her eyes
turned resolutely away from the face of Chester St. John, lest the
sight of it should rob her of the last remnant of strength she was
struggling so hard to maintain.

Isabel had thrown herself into an easy-chair near the door, and was
holding her handkerchief to her face as if deeply affected by the
scene, while Oscar Hilton was perhaps the most excited of all the
little group.

He feared to detain Iris lest something should be said to betray his
plot, and he dared not let her go forth alone lest St. John should
follow to protect her, and thus learn all the truth.

Mr. Hilton himself was puzzled to account for the mystery of Irisâ€™
connection with Broughton, for, from his own experience of his wifeâ€™s
beautiful daughter, he knew her to be pure as the untrodden snow, and
utterly incapable of the sin of which she stood accused.

Whatever the cause of the singular emotion she had betrayed at his
chance mention of Broughtonâ€™s name, he--Hilton--was satisfied with the
effect upon St. John, seeing as he did that the latterâ€™s newly awakened
faith in the girl he had loved so devotedly was again shattered.

Mr. Hilton made haste to respond to Irisâ€™ last words before St. John
had time to speak, if such had been that gentlemanâ€™s intention.

â€œMy dear child, if you can prove to us that we have wronged you, I, for
one, shall be happy, both for your own sake and that of the woman who
bears my name, your mother; and now, Iris, I shall appropriate the car
of one of my guests to take you to your home, as you are looking weak
and ill, and it is nearly midnight. St. John, I may have your machine
for this purpose, may I not?â€

At this direct appeal, Chester--who had crossed the room, and
stood leaning against the low marble mantel, with his eyes bent on
the floor, and his face pale with an agony he did not endeavor to
conceal--advanced quickly to the spot on which Iris stood, with a look
in his eyes that filled Oscar Hilton with fear.

St. John was about to ask Iris a question which would have betrayed him.

He was about to ask her where was the man whose fortune she had left
her home to follow, that he might have constituted himself her champion
and avenger, had he discovered that this lover had basely deserted or
deceived her.

At this moment light footsteps were heard approaching the door, and a
sweet, girlish voice calling gayly:

â€œChester! Isabel! Where are you, truants?â€ as the door was thrown open
unceremoniously to admit a fairylike vision in the person of pretty,
golden-haired Grace St. John, who had been Iris Tresilianâ€™s most
intimate and best-loved friend.

â€œAh, brother Chester, how wicked of you to keep Belle all this time
from her friends; we shall be obliged----â€

Graceâ€™s merry voice ceased all of a sudden, for her eyes had fallen
on the pale, drooped face of Iris, and although Chester made an
involuntary movement as if to step between them--a movement Iris
understood but too well, the impulsive Grace sprang quickly to the side
of the outcast, and clasped her white arms around the latterâ€™s neck,
crying joyously:

â€œOh, Iris, darling, I am so glad to see you; I have missed you so--I
shall be so happy now that you have come home, but, Iris, dear, why do
you sob so bitterly?â€

At the first word of kindness, and the first touch of Graceâ€™s caressing
hands, Iris had broken down utterly, and her slender frame was racked
with hoarse, convulsive sobs that were pitiful to hear.

Mr. Hilton addressed St. John in a harsh, imperative tone:

â€œTake your sister and Isabel back to the parlors while I attend to
Iris. This is no scene for either of them.â€

Iris heard these words, and put aside Graceâ€™s clinging arms.

â€œLet me go, Gracie, dear; I am no fit associate for you now,â€ she said
sadly and bitterly, walking with tottering steps toward the door as
she spoke; but Grace St. John reached it before her and prevented her
egress.

â€œWait, Iris; I must understand this scene,â€ she said firmly, her pretty
white-rose face growing paler than its wont, and her blue eyes glancing
reproachfully from face to face. â€œI do not understand why you left
your home, Iris. I only know that some great sorrow or misfortune has
fallen on you, and changed you almost beyond recognition. I have loved
you like a sister since you and I were little children, and yet you say
you are no fit associate for me now, Iris! What do you mean? Why do you
speak of leaving this house at such an hour, darling? If these doors
are closed against you, you shall come home with me. Donâ€™t shudder and
shake your head; I tell you, Iris, there is no barrier strong enough to
separate us, unless--unlessâ€--the girl hesitated, while a faint tinge
of color crept into her white face--â€œunless you had sinned beyond even
a motherâ€™s forgiveness, and----â€

The cold, metallic tones of Oscar Hiltonâ€™s voice here interposed:

â€œMiss St. John, it grieves me beyond the power of words to express, but
I am forced to tell you the truth, that this scene may be no longer
prolonged. Iris Tresilian has sinned beyond a motherâ€™s forgiveness. My
wife has cast her out of her heart, and forbidden me to receive her
again in my home. She----â€ A suppressed cry from Isabel checked the
words he was about to have added, and, following the glance of his
daughterâ€™s eyes, he saw the cause of her alarm.

The door near which Grace and Iris were standing had been pushed softly
open, and Evelyn Hilton was crossing the threshold, moving slowly, with
her hands clasped in front of her and her eyes bent downward.

She was attired in a long, loose white wrapper, and her fair hair,
escaped from its fastenings, hung far below her waist, giving her a
singularly weird and ghostlike appearance.

Oscar Hiltonâ€™s face grew white as marble, and great beads of
perspiration stood out thickly on his forehead.

â€œShe is asleep!â€ he whispered.

â€œNot a sound for your lives. A sudden awakening would cause her
death--I have been warned.â€

This was indeed true. Mrs. Hilton was a confirmed somnambulist, and her
doctor feared that a sudden awakening from one of these spells would
sooner or later prove fatal.

â€œSteal quietly out of the room, and leave her alone with me,â€ said
Hilton, in the same low whisper; but even while he spoke he saw that
this would be impossible, for the sleepwalker had paused directly in
the doorway, and stood in such a position that it would have been
impossible for any one to pass out without touching her, and the very
lightest touch would have awakened her.

There was a moment of intense silence, broken only by the heavy
breathing of the sleeping woman.

Iris trembled like a leaf in a storm, and was scarcely conscious
that it was Chester St. Johnâ€™s firm hand that had forced her into an
easy-chair, against the back of which he was now leaning, with his face
hidden in his hands.

Presently the lips of the somnambulist opened, and she spoke, slowly
and distinctly:

â€œDonâ€™t ask me to do it, Oscar; Iâ€™ve been a bad, unfeeling mother
always, but I cannot do this thing; it is such a cruel letter--it will
make Chester St. John despise her--I can copy her handwriting--yes--I
know--but to say she left her home for an unworthy lover--while I know
that all her heart is given to him--to Chester--no! no! Oscar! Donâ€™t
threaten to betray my secret--I will write--anything--anything you
dictate----â€

Tears were streaming down the poor, wan cheeks of the unfortunate woman
now, while Iris with difficulty checked her own wild sobbing, and
Chester St. John whispered hoarsely:

â€œWhat can this mean!â€ And dropping on his knees, weak as a fainting
woman, hid his face on the arm of the chair in which Iris reclined.

Oscar Hilton had crept noiselessly to his daughterâ€™s side, and was
pressing his hand firmly on her shoulder to prevent her from making any
outcry; for, base and worldly as this man was, he loved his wife with
all the strength of which his selfish nature was capable, and bore even
this betrayal of his baseness rather than silence her at the risk of
her life.

Again there was a moment of silence, while the fingers of the sleeper
made the motions of writing, slowly and carefully, pausing often, and
bending her head as if to study some written page before her.

She seemed to have finished at last, all to the signing of the name,
and this she repeated aloud:

â€œIris Tresilian,â€ adding, after a brief pause, during which she had
sobbed like a child: â€œIt is done, Oscar. I have bought your silence at
the price of my daughterâ€™s reputation, even as I purchased wealth at
the cost of my husbandâ€™s honor.â€

The last words were spoken very faintly, and Mrs. Hilton now came
farther into the room, with her hands outstretched as if searching for
something.

â€œMy chair, Oscar; wheel it close to the fire,â€ she whispered, and
Hilton sprang forward quickly to place a chair for her; but in his
agitation his foot struck against a small ormolu stand upon which
Isabel had placed a glass tank containing several gold fishes.

The stand was overturned, and the glass fell with a loud crash,
shattered to pieces on the floor.

The eyes of the somnambulist sprang wide open; she gazed wildly
from one to another of the surrounding faces, and with a cry that
echoed from basement to attic, fell to the ground, writhing in strong
convulsions.

â€œGood God, I have killed her!â€ And Oscar Hilton threw himself
frantically on his knees beside her, while the guests, attracted by
that wild and pitiful cry, came thronging to the spot, and Iris,
sobbing out the words: â€œMamma! Oh, my poor mother!â€ attempted to reach
the spot where the latter lay, but fell back, feeble and helpless as an
infant, in Chester St. Johnâ€™s outstretched arms.
