Pale and trembling from her fright, Jessie leaned against the wall when
Frank Laurier returned to her, jaunty and debonair, saying lightly:

â€œI have pitched the bold fellow down the steps, and he has gone off out
of the way. Why, how pale and ill you look! Were you so much frightened
of a kiss?â€

â€œYes--from that wretch!â€ she faltered, and his deep-blue eyes laughed
at her quizzically, and with something like daring in them as he led
her out to the pavement to an elegant little trap, and, taking up the
reins, drove off in great style for the park.

Jessieâ€™s heart throbbed with pride and joy, but she still trembled
violently from the struggle with Doyle.

She half sobbed:

â€œOh, I never can thank you enough for driving him away! If he had
kissed me--oh, I should have died of disgust!â€

â€œDied of a kiss, ha, ha!â€ laughed the young man gayly, so amused at the
idea that it took firm hold of his memory, to be recalled at a fateful
aftertime.

â€œHave you never been kissed by a young man, then, little Jessie?â€ he
added, still laughing.

â€œOh, no, no, never!â€ blushing deeply.

â€œThen he will be a lucky young fellow who gets the first kiss from you!
I wonder who he will be! Can you guess?â€

The great, dark eyes stole a shy glance at him under the drooping
lashes, as she whispered demurely:

â€œOnly the man I shall marry!â€

â€œOh, indeed!â€

Did he think she was chaffing him, or coquettishly daring him, or what?
It is certain he was in a reckless, flippant mood, and that swift
glance of hers warmed his blood like wine. They were in the park now,
driving under the shadow of some autumn-colored trees, and all in a
flash his arm slipped round her waist, the brown head bent over the
golden one.

  Two faces bent--
  Bent in a swift and daring dream,
  An ecstasy of trembling bliss,
  And sealed together in a kiss.

She did not struggle, sweet Jessie, against this bold caress, simply
yielded to it with a delirious throb of joy, letting his lips drain the
sweetness of hers unhindered, as a bee sips the sweets of the rose, her
thrilling form resting quiescent against the arm that clasped her close
to his heart. When he released her, neither spoke a word, Jessie sat
very still, her form inclined slightly toward him, her eyes downcast
and shining, her cheeks warmly flushed, her moist lips tremulous, her
bosom heaving with emotion, a lovely picture of girlish tenderness on
which the young manâ€™s eyes rested with pleasure.

He touched up the sleek, black ponies with the whip, and directly
they were borne into the thick of the crowd that made the beautiful
drives a gay, changeful panorama of fine horses, smart turnouts, and
magnificently dressed women.

Frank Laurier blent readily with the animated crowd, sitting erect
with a very pale face, compressed lips, and eyes that glittered with
a blue fire as he swept them eagerly and restlessly over the passing
faces, returning salutations every moment or so, and seemingly
almost forgetting the girl by his side in some secret, overmastering
excitement.

As for her, if she could have thought of anything but that kiss and the
bliss of his nearness, she would have begun to feel out of place in her
cheap, simple dress there in the moving throng of richly garbed women,
whose glances rested in wonder on the fair face and cheap attire of the
girl by Laurierâ€™s side. She did not, indeed, guess how different she
looked from the others, or how very strange it was for a man in his
position to run the gantlet of all those curious, surprised eyes--he,
one of the fashionable four hundred, with that little working girl by
his side.

If the innocent child gave a thought to the incongruity, she only felt
it as a tribute of his regard for her.

She felt an exquisite pleasure in thus being exhibited at his side
to the habituÃ©s of his particular world, and did not realize the
strangeness of his inattention to herself, or the eagerness of his
excited glance as it roved from carriage to carriage filled with fair
faces and bright, sparkling eyes, as if in restless search for some one.

At last!

Jessie, close to his side, felt the young man give a quick start of
surprise and emotion, at the same moment lifting his hat with a low
bow.

She saw passing them on the drive a splendid, low victoria, containing
two handsome, elegantly dressed ladies, one past the first blush of
girlhood, the other--oh!--the dark beauty of this morning who had come
to Madame Bartoâ€™s to know her fate and fortune!

Jessieâ€™s dark, uplifted eyes met and held for a moment the flashing
orbs of the beautiful brunette, and all in a moment she felt as if
she were withering in the heat of some desert simoom, so fierce and
malevolent was that look that seemed to scorch her very soul.

She thought with a thrill of nameless fear:

â€œThe beautiful stranger hates me!--I wonder why!â€

But the next moment the fear was blotted out in a new terror.

No one could ever tell what frightened Frank Laurierâ€™s spirited ponies,
but just as they passed the victoria they bolted wildly and ran away
in spite of his close grip on the reins, creating a terrible panic and
confusion, and barely missing a collision with another carriage.
