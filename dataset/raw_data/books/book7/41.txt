Coraâ€™s eyes flashed, her lips and face went ashen white, her form
trembled with passion, as, catching the boys by their shoulders, she
shook both violently, screaming:

â€œYou little meddlesome wretches, how dare you sneak around this way,
poking your noses into things that are none of your business! Go away,
and if I ever find either one of you up in this hall again, I will kill
you both!â€

The elder boy shook himself loose from her angry grasp and tried to
rescue Willie, saying tearfully:

â€œWe didnâ€™t mean no harm, maâ€™am.â€

â€œWell, keep away from the servantsâ€™ hall, hereafter. Go downstairs
now, and never come up here any more, and mind you never tell any one
I slapped you and shook you just now. If you do I will shut you up in
jail to stay forever!â€ menaced Cora, with flashing eyes.

The boys started to go down obediently, Willie hushing his low sobs in
sheer terror, then Cora flew back to the locked door, opened it with a
key that she took from a little concealed recess, beneath a small rug
that lay before the door.

She did not dream that the curious Mark had darted back to the head of
the stairway, and was closely watching her movements.

He put his arm around Willie, whispering excitedly:

â€œShe has unlocked that room and gone and shut herself up in it, the
mean, spiteful thing! Do you know I believe she has got something shut
up in there.â€

â€œI hate her, and Iâ€™m going to tell aunt on her!â€ came the sobbed reply.

â€œNo, donâ€™t say nothinâ€™, but letâ€™s watch our chance to get even with the
mean thing by seeing into that locked door. I seen where she got the
key!â€ consoled Mark, whose curiosity was a predominating trait.

â€œYes,â€ muttered Willie, hopes of vengeance rising in his mind. â€œWeâ€™ll
get in that room and see what â€™tis sheâ€™s hiding.â€

Then they pattered downstairs again and no one was the wiser for the
little scene that had passed upstairs in the corridor.

Cora remained in the locked room only a few minutes, and on leaving it
she again turned the key and slipped it in its place, then sped along
the corridor and down the stairs again to her own rooms with an evil
light in her dark, down-cast eyes that boded no good to any one who
crossed the path of her desires.

The two boys waited and watched for an opportunity to get up into the
servantsâ€™ hall again, but such a close vigil did Cora keep that they
were unable to do so.

At last the wedding day arrived when Cora and Frank, and Mrs. Dalrymple
and her divorced husband, were to be made one.

On the morning of this day the two brides were very busy, each in her
own apartments were being robed by their respective maids for the
noon ceremony--Cora in a handsome traveling gown and hat to go away
immediately, and her aunt in a dainty confection of blue brocade and
rich lace for an informal luncheon with the few wedding guests.

Love and hope beat high in the breasts of both--the girl who had played
such high stakes to gain a manâ€™s heart, the woman who had never known
the value of love till it was lost and found again.

The drawing-room and corridors were gracefully but not too lavishly
decorated for the ceremony with stately palms and rich roses, whose
fragrance filled the air with sweetness.

Little Mark and Willie were not watched so closely, and roved hither
and thither about the great house, whispering to each other, and, truth
to tell, feeling almost too grand in the fine suits of velvet with rich
lace collars that had been put upon them to grace the occasion. Being
left somewhat to their own devices in the prevailing excitement, they
naturally turned at once to the locked room on the upper floor.

â€œWe must do it now or never, because she is going off with that Mr.
Laurier as soon as she is married, to stay a long while,â€ said Mark.

â€œYes, we must. Letâ€™s go now.â€ And they stole unseen upstairs and Mark
soon found the key beneath the rug. But it was so large, and the lock
so strong that when they got it in they could not turn it.

â€œPut your ear to the keyhole and listen. Donâ€™t you hear something?â€
said Mark.

â€œYes--sounds like a little kitty cryinâ€™; pore liâ€™l sing!â€ whimpered
Willie.

It lacked only fifteen minutes to the ceremony now. The two bridegrooms
with the guests and the bishop had arrived and were waiting
downstairs. Everything was in readiness for the hour.

The few wedding guests whispered to each other when Cora entered that
she was the palest, most frightened-looking bride they had ever seen.
What was it that could be preying upon her mind upon such an occasion
as this?

But, they added kindly enough, that it was no wonder, for after her two
former fateful wedding days who could blame her for being nervous and
apprehensive of disaster.

She came in quietly enough, with downcast eyes, with her aunt, for the
wedding was to be quite informal, the ceremony being performed first
for the elder couple.

Frank Laurier was there looking quite as pale and troubled as his
bride, but again the guests excused his perturbation, whispering:

â€œHe is afraid something is going to happen.â€

A sort of undefined dread of evil pervaded the air.

The bishop arose and opened his book as the elder couple moved in
front of him, and the happiness on those two fine faces, the chastened
happiness of reunion after long grief and pain--almost dissipated the
lowering cloud of presentiment over every spirit.

Brief questions were asked, clear responses made, and the ring slipped
over the brideâ€™s slender finger, token of a union never to be broken
â€œuntil death do us part.â€

Kisses, congratulations, tears, and smiles, for the happy pair, then
they moved aside for the others with a prayer in their hearts that
these two might not sail forth upon such stormy seas of matrimonial
disaster as they had done in ignorant youth.

None had noticed in the excitement of the congratulations that three
more guests had arrived--three men who had bribed the servants to let
them look on at the scene from behind the tall palms at the open door
of the drawing-room.

Pale, grave, silent, these three men watched the scene with eager eyes,
as Frank and Cora stood side by side breathing the words that bound
their lives in one forever.

Suddenly one gasped and started wildly forward as the minister repeated
mechanically the customary warning, for any one who knew any impediment
to the marriage to speak now or forever after hold his peace.

This man, tall, pale, with a sinister scar on his brow, and a painful
limp, crossed the room as swiftly as his infirmity would permit, and
thundered:

â€œI forbid the marriage. She is my wife!â€

The bishop dropped his prayer book in amazement, and with startled
cries, all faced around upon the newcomer.

Cries of doubtful recognition shrilled over every lip:

â€œErnest Noel!â€

Cora clung with frantic hands to Frankâ€™s arm, gazing with horrified
eyes at the daring intruder.

There stood Ernest Noel in the flesh, though his good looks were marred
by a scar on his cheek and a decided limp received in some accident.
Over one of his shoulders peered the grave, noble face of the minister
who had married them in the mock marriage that had turned out a real
one, and over the other she saw, like a grinning fiendâ€™s, Carey Doyleâ€™s
with an ugly sneer on the mustached lips.

She was dizzy and her brain reeled. She felt like a weak swimmer in a
strong sea swept away by the relentless and treacherous undertow.

In the momentary silence that followed their cries of recognition,
Ernest Noel continued earnestly:

â€œThis lady is my wife, but I do not charge her with attempted bigamy.
She believed me dead.â€

â€œExplain!â€ thundered Frank Laurier, thrilled with chivalrous pity for
the drooping figure that clutched his arm with frantic hands.

Ernest Noel bowed gravely, and said:

â€œTwo years ago I was frantic with love for Miss Ellyson and tried to
win her from you, Frank Laurier. We two were the principals in a mock
marriage at some charitable affair, and in my desperation I made the
ceremony a real one, taking out the necessary license and securing
a young minister, Mr. Kincaid, to officiate. Some time afterward I
ventured to confess to my bride the imposition I had practiced on her
and was met by such indignant reproaches that I was driven to--suicide!

â€œDisappointed in my love, I sprang into a deep pit to end my life, but
the fall did not kill me. I lingered on in agony till the next day,
when this man with me, Carey Doyle, discovered and rescued me from my
perilous situation, taking me to the home of some country friends of
his, where I was cared for many months ere fully restored to myself.

â€œIt was rumored that I had mysteriously disappeared, and the report
of my suicide was accepted as correct. Carey Doyle, for the sake of a
whim, kept the secret of my identity, and so for many months I remained
as one dead to the world that formerly knew me; while regaining my
consciousness at last I learned that Cora had been almost fatally
burned and would be the inmate of a hospital perhaps for years.
In despair I forswore all former associations, and no one but the
executors of my property were informed of my continued existence, while
I brooded miserably over my faults and the wreck I had made of my own
life, my selfish passion and reckless folly. I determined never to
return to the world, but this morning Carey Doyle came to tell me that
I must save Cora from bigamy by forbidding her contemplated marriage
with another.â€

Cora and Doyle at that moment exchanged malevolent glances, and she
understood all.

In the beginning the wretch had concealed the fact of Noelâ€™s continued
existence that he might more effectually pursue his scheme of blackmail.

But again she looked from his taunting face back to the grave, sad face
of Noel, who now added:

â€œI am here to say to Cora and you all, that my marriage to her was
perfectly legal as far as church and State could make it. I love her
still in spite of everything, and if she will forgive me the wrong I
did in making her my wife against her will, and wishes to go with me,
I on my part will forgive any harm she ever did me and gladly take her
to my heart. On the other hand, if she prefers to secure a divorce and
marry Laurier, I will make no fight against it. Her will shall be my
law!â€

It was a most noble rÃ´le the man was playing in concealing Coraâ€™s sins
and taking them all on his own broad shoulders.

He had bought Carey Doyleâ€™s silence, and was prepared to keep Coraâ€™s
secret forever from the world in atonement for the one great wrong he
had done her--the wrong to which she had tempted him by her heartless
coquetry.

Forgiving all her sins by the strength of his love he hoped to win her
yet from Laurier, and awaited her answer with burning impatience.

But she clung all the closer to Frank, though she could read by his
face that he thought she ought to turn to Noel.

She was opening her lips to cry out passionately that she loved only
Laurier and would sue for a divorce, when Mark and Willie Lyndon rushed
upon the scene, panting and excited, crying breathlessly:

â€œOh, Uncle Leon, Aunt Verna, come with us! We have found our dear
Cousin Jessie at last, but she is dead!â€

Like a flash in the confusion of that startling announcement, Cora
dropped Frankâ€™s arm and flew to Noelâ€™s side:

Her face was ghastly as she breathed in his ear:

â€œCome, Ernest, the machine is waiting! Let us fly! Fly to the other end
of the world!â€

Half dazed with the suddenness of the turn things were taking, he
followed her lead, and while the others rushed upstairs, he and Cora
sprang into the limousine and were driven to the railway station.

The secret of the locked room was no longer a secret.

A score of people followed the eager footsteps of the little lads
upstairs to the sad sight they had encountered on opening the door.

There lay sweet Jessie, wan, pale, terribly emaciated, and still as
death on the low couch--a sight that brought cries of grief and horror
from womenâ€™s lips, and tears to the eyes of men.

Fortunately the old family physician was in the company.

It looked like death, but he would not pronounce it so. He remembered
what a terrible mistake he had made over Jessie before.

He knelt by her side, doing all he could to restore life, and all the
while he was inwardly praying:

â€œGod help me! Give back her beautiful life to us!â€

And all the time the anguished mother and father, the distracted lover,
the interested friends, were echoing the prayer in their hearts.

Oh, what joy thrilled their hearts when the doctor found a faint little
sign of life, but what long and skillful nursing it took before Jessie
was well again, or even strong enough to tell the story of Coraâ€™s
satanic cruelty!

But they were happy days when she was convalescing with so many dear
ones by her side--her reunited parents, her precious little cousins,
and last but not least, her devoted lover, Frank Laurier.

They did not hide their love from each other now, they could talk of
the past without embarrassment, and once when Darling Jessie, as they
called her now, scolded him for that first stolen kiss, he retorted by
telling her of that second kiss upon the sea that had seemingly brought
her back to life.

They had many things to tell her, but the story that interested her
most of all was of her own apparent death and her interment in the old
family vault.

She knew now that it was no dream, the memories she had cherished of
her motherâ€™s sorrow over her coffin, and Frank Laurierâ€™s words of
passionate love and grief. She would cherish them deep in her heart
forever.

As for Mark and Willie, they received the most idolatrous love from all.

â€œIt was so noble in you, Verna, to take them to our own home so
generously that I was always thinking what I could do to reward you for
your goodness, but, lo! God paid the debt of gratitude by making the
little lads the saviors of our own daughter,â€ the fond husband cried,
with deep emotion.

In the following spring Ernest Noel wrote to Mrs. Dalrymple telling her
of Coraâ€™s death at his villa in Italy.

Shortly after the announcement of this sad news Frank Laurier and the
girl he loved were united in the holy bands of matrimony.
