Madame Bartoâ€™s doorbell clanged impatiently twice, and then a deeply
veiled young lady was admitted, and shown to the small parlor where
madame received her callers. She glanced around her, muttering:

â€œAlmost two years since I was here, yet how familiar everything
appears! Madame herself would have the same old lying story to tell,
perchance, if I were to cross her palm again with silver! Pah! the
dingy hole disgusts me. I wish that wretch would hasten! I have no time
to waste here, and Aunt Verna so ill that it was unseemly for me to
quit the house.â€

She paced up and down the floor with the impatience of a caged lioness.

â€œWhy donâ€™t he come? It is money again, I suppose! Money--always money!
And since my unfaithful guardian speculated with my money and lost so
much of it, I have scarcely enough for my own needs. I shall be glad
when I am safely married to Frank, for then I shall defy Carey Doyle
to do his worst. I can deny his story if he dares bring any charges,
and Frank Laurier, I know, will defend his wifeâ€™s honor to the last.
Ah, how I long to see him again, my love, my own! His steamer is due
to-day, and I am wild with impatience. Ah! what cruel suspense I have
endured since he went away. And even now I dread the meeting. My beauty
is not as brilliant as before my terrible accident, and I shall always
be compelled to depend on cosmetics to aid the charms that before were
unsurpassed!â€

She flung back her thick veil and paused before a mirror, studying her
face intently, as she had contracted a habit of doing now.

She was indeed changed from the brilliant Cora of two years ago.

The beauty specialists had done their best, but they could not restore
all that the cruel flames had licked up so relentlessly that fatal
wedding eve.

She had tried to cheat Frank Laurier, but she could not cheat herself,
and she dreaded inexpressibly the moment of their meeting.

â€œWill his love survive the change? Has it, indeed, survived our long
parting?â€ she asked herself anxiously, for she had not failed to notice
how indifferent his letters had been, and how few and far between.

She thought:

â€œPerhaps he thinks I should release him, and that his indifference will
goad me into it, but I will never do it, not even if he asked me! After
all, I am afraid Frank is rather fickle in his love! He turned from me
to another--that Jessie Lyndon that my aunt claimed as her daughter. If
she had lived, I fear she would have made me trouble with Frank, for he
must have secretly admired her, and it is fortunate for me in all ways
that she died--for one thing, on account of her rivalry; the other,
that now Aunt Verna will leave me her millions when she dies! And that
may not be long, for she is certainly very ill now, and--ah!â€ her low
soliloquy ended with a start as a young man abruptly entered the room.

â€œGood morning, Miss Ellyson. I am glad you obeyed my summons so
promptly,â€ he sneered, with coarse triumph.

She frowned angrily as she cried:

â€œYou are impertinent, Carey Doyle. How dared you summon me here?â€

â€œYou have ignored all my letters asking for money, and I had too much
respect for your position to annoy you at your auntâ€™s, so I thought it
was the best plan for you to meet me here and discuss matters.â€

â€œWhat is it that you wish?â€

â€œMoney, of course!â€

â€œWretch! I have paid you over and over for keeping that miserable
secret!â€

â€œYou have not paid me half that it was worth to you, my proud lady!â€
Carey Doyle answered boldly.

She was furious with rage, her eyes gleaming, her face death-white, her
small hands clenched. She thought bitterly that she wished he were dead
and lying by the side of her victim down in the old stone quarry, the
thought of whose ghastly secret had kept her sleepless many a night.

But she had reasoned to herself many a time that the crime could never
be traced to her, for she had covered up the clues too cleverly by her
story of his suicidal threats.

Even if they were to find the whitening bones of Ernest Noel down in
the dim old quarry, they could not fasten his death on anybody. They
would simply believe he had carried out his threat of suicide.

Her anger blazed at the thought that in this insolent man, the witness
of her evil deed, lay her only peril.

â€œI will not give you any more money, I have exhausted my resources.
Besides, I am not afraid of your story. You will not dare repeat it,
for I would give you into custody for attempted blackmail!â€ she hissed
threateningly.

But Carey Doyleâ€™s laugh was not reassuring. It stung her to fury, yet
inspired her with alarm, though she persisted:

â€œI am not afraid of you. No one will take your word against mine!â€

â€œYou may risk it if you choose,â€ he answered, with persistent
nonchalance.

She measured him with a scornful glance, but she could not cow him, and
her heart sank with fear.

By to-morrow Frank Laurier would be in New York. Within a week, if
womanâ€™s wit could compass it, she would be his wife. Dare she risk any
disclosure that might rouse her loverâ€™s suspicions, and so postpone the
wedding again?

She groaned in spirit, but she decided that she dare not defy Carey
Doyle until she had a husband to defend her against his charges.

â€œHow much do you require?â€

â€œJust one thousand dollars!â€

â€œYou ask too much.â€

â€œI cannot do with less.â€

â€œYou must!â€

â€œI will not!â€

They glared at each other, but she saw that she could not shake his
resolution.

Swallowing her rage and chagrin, she expostulated:

â€œIt is but a month ago I gave you five hundred
dollars--and--and--since that night you helped me you have had four
thousand dollars.â€

â€œFor which I am most profoundly grateful,â€ airily, â€œand a poor price
for such a secret, too, so you shouldnâ€™t mind a last payment such as I
ask for now.â€

â€œA last payment! You will be calling for more in a week.â€

â€œI swear to you I will not. I am about to leave the city for Alaska.â€

â€œDo you mean it?â€

â€œAs surely as the sun shines in the heavens this bright September day!
Perhaps you have read, Miss Ellyson, of the wonderful gold finds in
Alaska that have stirred the whole country into a fever. Well, I have
joined a party to go out to the gold diggings, and I mean to make
my fortune or lose my life, whichever fate wills. It will cost me a
thousand dollars to get to the Klondike, so you see I shall have no
means of returning from those frozen wilds till I make my pile. Surely
you would not begrudge a thousand dollars to be rid of me forever?â€

No, she would not. It would be a small price to pay to rid herself of
this terrible incubus.

She had read in all the newspapers of the perils of the awful journey
to Alaska, and she thought in her heart with joy that surely he could
never return from beyond the far Yukon.

Cora had shuddered at the tales of Alaska, but now she brightened at
the thought that Carey Doyle was not, indeed, likely to return from so
grim a journey.

â€œSince you need it so much and promise never to ask for more, I will
try to get the sum for you within the week,â€ she said, adding:

â€œI will send a letter to this address telling you when and how I will
pay it to you. Is that satisfactory?â€

â€œPerfectly, for I know you will keep your word,â€ he replied, smiling to
himself at the victory he had won over the haughty girl who scorned him
even while she cringed beneath his power.

She inclined her head haughtily, drew down the thick veil again, and
swept out of the house down to her waiting limousine, and so back to
Mrs. Dalrympleâ€™s, where, since her return from the hospital, she again
made her home, the Van Dorns being indefinitely absent in Paris.
