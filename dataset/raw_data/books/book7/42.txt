â€œWhat do you mean by disobeying my orders? Didnâ€™t I tell you I would
see no one to-night? How dare you take it upon yourself to act contrary
to my wishes?â€

Peter, the servant, to whom these angry, impatient words were
addressed, stood meekly in the doorway of his masterâ€™s library, half in
and half out of the room, waiting for Mr. Oscar Hiltonâ€™s loud voice to
cease before venturing to explain his reason for thus intruding on the
latterâ€™s privacy.

â€œPlease, sir, I didnâ€™t forget your orders, but if youâ€™ll remember, sir,
you told me only yesterday never to deny you to Mr. St. John----â€

As Peter uttered this name Oscar Hiltonâ€™s face, which had been
haggard and pale as if some deep sorrow weighed upon him, brightened
wonderfully, and his voice lost its angry tone.

â€œYou are right, Peter; say to Mr. St. John that I will see him here,
and----â€

At this moment Peter drew himself back from the doorway, and a young
girl entered the room--a petite and fairylike creature, looking even
younger than her eighteen years, with eyes of that peculiar blue that
darkens into purple, a complexion clear and fair as the lotus leaf,
and hair of a deep reddish brown that shone like dull gold in the soft
shaded light.

She was dressed richly, as became the daughter of Oscar Hilton--who
was supposed to be one of the richest men in New York. But that
gentlemanâ€™s face betrayed neither admiration nor love as she advanced
into the room and stood before him.

â€œWe are ready for Mrs. Laurierâ€™s reception, papa, and I wanted you to
see my costume for the occasion before Isabel came to you, because
I knew how my poor little self will fade into insignificance and be
totally eclipsed by the superior beauty of my queenly sister--but what
is the matter? Papa, you look pale and tired. Shall I stay at home and
read for you? Indeed, I do not care about the party--do let me stay
with you, papa.â€

The girlâ€™s sweet voice--at first full of playfulness and merriment--had
grown tender and earnest with the utterance of the last words, and she
came toward her father with hands extended as if to embrace him; but
Oscar Hilton repulsed her almost rudely.

â€œGo to the reception by all means, Iris, and donâ€™t be so silly and
childish. I am expecting a visitor just now, and cannot be bothered.
Say to Isabel that I will see her when she comes back from Mrs.
Laurierâ€™s. I have writing to do to-night, and shall not have retired.â€

Iris Hilton bowed, and turned from her father without a word, but the
sweet, girlish face had lost all its look of brightness, and the pretty
lips quivered piteously while she went to do his bidding.

Mr. Hilton seemed to breathe more freely when she was gone, and it
would have been hard to fathom the expression of his eyes as he
followed the graceful little figure in its retreat from the room,
muttering below his breath:

â€œHer â€˜queenly sister,â€™ she called my dark-eyed Isabel. Ah, God! how
easily I could bear the ruin that threatens me, and the disgrace that
must inevitably follow, if my Isabel were provided for, my proud,
imperious darling.â€

Mr. Hiltonâ€™s meditations were here interrupted by the entrance of his
visitor, Mr. Chester St. John, a handsome, distinguished-looking man
of thirty years, whose easy, graceful bearing and cultured manner
proclaimed him at once a gentleman in the truest sense of the word.

Mr. Hilton received him with every token of welcome, and St. John
entered at once into the object of his visit.

â€œI think you must have guessed long ago, Mr. Hilton,â€ he said, when
cozily seated with that gentleman before a bright grate fire in the
luxuriously furnished library, â€œthat I love your beautiful daughter
with all my heart. I have not spoken to her of this love, as yet, but
I think--I have dared to hope, that she reciprocates my feeling, and I
only await your permission to ask her to make me the happiest of men.â€

St. John paused here, waiting for Mr. Hiltonâ€™s answer.

It was so long before the latter made any reply to Chesterâ€™s proposal
that the young man began to fear he had received it unfavorably.

â€œIs it possible that you have other views for your daughter, Mr.
Hilton?â€ he asked, somewhat proudly, but with a tremor of real anxiety
in his deep-toned voice.

â€œNo, no, my dear boy, you are the one man of all others to whom I could
think for a moment of giving my precious child. I feel--nay! I know
that you are worthy of her, and I will not stand between her and her
love.â€

â€œThanks, my dear sir, and I assure you you shall never have cause to
regret the confidence you have placed in me. It shall be the labor of
my life to make Iris happy----â€

â€œIris!â€

At Chester St. Johnâ€™s mention of this name Oscar Hilton sprang to his
feet, with every trace of color dying out of his face, and his hands
pressed tightly to his heart.

â€œIris!â€ he again ejaculated hoarsely; but when Chester sprang to his
side in alarm he waved him back authoritatively. â€œIt is nothing,â€ he
cried, with quick, gasping breaths, â€œI am subject to these sudden
spasms of pain--around my heart--and it is so natural for me to call
on--Iris--there! it is over now, but I would like to be alone. Come
to-morrow, St. John, and Iris will give you her answer.â€

Chester was not in the least offended by this abrupt dismissal, having
no suspicion that the pain of which Mr. Hilton had complained was
purely imaginary, and that there was a deeper cause for that ashen,
pale face and those trembling hands.

He bade Irisâ€™ father good night with many expressions of regret,
promising to call for Irisâ€™ answer on the morrow, and taking his
departure at last with such a look of hope upon his face that one might
have guessed what he expected the girlâ€™s answer to be.
