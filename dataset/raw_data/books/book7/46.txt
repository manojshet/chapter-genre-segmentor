â€œI called to see your dressmaker this evening, Clara, and she promises
to have your work completed to-morrow, without fail, and--but by the
way, my dear, I am not quite certain that the young girl will be able
to keep her promise. I caught a glimpse of her invalid mother, and it
is my belief that the poor woman will not live till morning. I suppose,
in that case, the other young lady will be obliged to finish the work
for you.â€

The speaker was Mr. Charles Broughton, and the woman he addressed Mrs.
Clara Neville, a haughty, handsome widow of thirty, and Mr. Broughtonâ€™s
affianced wife.

The fair widow would never have owned to herself that she could
harbor the slightest feeling of jealousy toward such an insignificant
personage as a dressmakerâ€™s associate; but there was something in Mr.
Broughtonâ€™s expression and manner of speaking of that other lady that
brought an angry glitter to the black eyes of his betrothed.

â€œWho is the person you are speaking of? I never had the pleasure
of meeting any other sewing woman in Jennyâ€™s home. I have always
understood that Jenny Mason was without friends or connections in this
country.â€

â€œI saw a face in Jenny Masonâ€™s home to-night that brought back----â€

He did not finish the sentence, but threw his hands suddenly over his
face, shivering in the warmth and luxury of the cozy apartment in which
he sat, as if he had been facing a wintry blast.

â€œLet me finish the sentence for you, Mr. Broughton; the face you saw
to-night brought back the memory of some woman you have loved in the
past. What a pity that the possessor of this face should be only a
working girl.â€

â€œBy heavens! you wrong me, Clara,â€ he cried hoarsely, â€œthe girl I saw
to-night reminded me of my bitterest enemy--of a woman I have cause to
hate--and whose name I curse every hour of my life. If I thought one
drop of that womanâ€™s blood flowed in the veins of this working girl I
would hunt her out of every place she found employment. I would never
rest until I had visited the sin of her--but what wild talk is this?
The woman whose name I curse is living in luxury wherever she may be,
and the poor little seamstress is not to blame for her remarkable
resemblance to one who must be a stranger to her. Never send me there
again, Clara; the sight of that girlâ€™s face aroused all the demon
within me, and awakened passions that have lain dormant for years.â€

He was a handsome man, despite his five-and-forty years. His thick,
wavy black hair showed no thread of silver, and his eyes were keen and
bright.

He was a general favorite among the fair sex, although but little was
known of his antecedents or former history.

If there was an air of mystery surrounding him, this fact only tended
to make him more interesting in the eyes of the ladies, and there were
many who envied Clara Neville her conquest when it became known that
this fascinating little widow had won handsome Charley Broughtonâ€™s love.

Clara herself was very proud of her stately, distinguished-looking
lover, and insanely jealous of him, as her recent exhibition of temper
may have led the reader to suppose.

She was half frightened now at the storm of passion her own words had
evoked, but she had no longer any fear that he admired the girl he had
met at Jenny Masonâ€™s.

â€œPray calm yourself, my dear Charles,â€ she said; â€œyou shall never go to
my dressmakerâ€™s again; you will surely be ill if you excite yourself
so; I shall be quite anxious about you when you leave me; please look a
little more cheerful for my sake.â€

â€œFor your sake, my pretty pleader, I would accomplish a much harder
task,â€ replied Broughton, with assumed gayety, as he encircled the
widowâ€™s form with his arm, and pressed a kiss on her white forehead.

During the remainder of that evening he was as loving and attentive
as even the most exacting lady love could have desired, and left Mrs.
Neville in the happy belief that her idolatrous fondness for him was
fully reciprocated.

But once outside her home the manâ€™s whole demeanor changed, and as he
wended his way to the hotel at which he had taken up his residence, he
was saying to himself:

â€œBah! how hard it is for me to humor her jealous whims, and to keep up
a pretense of fondness for her. If I had allowed her to continue in
her belief that I admired this Maggie Gordon, she would have succeeded
in getting the girl out of the way.â€

Charles Broughton had reached his hotel by this time, and encountered a
friend who had been awaiting his arrival in the reading room, and who
greeted him with an exclamation of astonishment.

â€œHeavens, Charley, how ill you look!â€

â€œNever mind my looks, my friend; I am a little under the weather, but
I donâ€™t care to be reminded of it continually. Come up to my den, and
let me see if a chat with you and a glass of wine will not restore me,â€
said Broughton carelessly; and a few moments later found the friends
chatting and laughing over their wine and cigars.

But always between Charles Broughton and the ruby liquid he raised so
often to his lips came the beautiful face and violet eyes of the girl
who had declared herself to be Maggie Gordon.
