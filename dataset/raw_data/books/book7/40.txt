When Dalrymple tore himself away at last to prosecute the search for
his daughter, it occurred to him to seek her at the home of Mrs.
Godfrey, the aunt of his little nephews, Willie and Mark.

It was a great disappointment to him that she had heard nothing of
Jessie, but after all he had hardly expected it. A forlorn hope had led
him there, coupled with the desire to see his little nephews.

When the little lads were led in to him their chief interest in their
new-found uncle was that he was the father of their loved Cousin
Jessie. They plied him with anxious questions about her, to which he
could only answer sadly that she had gone away for a while, but he
hoped she would come back soon.

His first thought was for Mrs. Godfrey, whose care of his nephews he
felt was deserving of a fair reward, so he presented her with a check
for a thousand dollars.

The poor, toil-worn soul was overwhelmed with surprise and joy.

The sum represented a fortune in her eyes, to which the grateful tears
rushed in torrents.

â€œOh, I can never thank you enough! This will be like riches to my poor
sister and me! She can have the comforts that an incurably sick woman
needs now, thanks to your generosity! But I feel I donâ€™t deserve it,
when I remember how I had to send sweet Jessie away to earn her own
living!â€

â€œDo not worry over that, because it could not be helped. You did more
than you were able, taking the little boys on your hands. I shall take
care of them now and put them to school.â€

â€œThey were welcome to all I could do, poor little ones, and I love them
dearly as the children of my dead brother and his sweet wife, but I
am glad you can take care of them, and bring them up to be something
in the great world,â€ she replied, with honest pride in her brotherâ€™s
children.

â€œI will do my best,â€ he replied, bowing himself out, after promising to
return in a day or two and make arrangements for taking Mark and Willie
away.

Then so eager was he for another sight of Verna, that he must needs
call again and tell her about his nephews and ask her advice about
their future.

â€œI believe I neglected to tell you that I am fairly rich myself and can
afford to do well by the boys without wronging you or Jessie,â€ he added.

To his surprise and delight she replied:

â€œI am almost sorry you are rich, Leon, for I would like to show you
how generous I could be with these little ones, but they shall be my
nephews as well as yours, and I insist on your bringing them here
to-morrow to make their home with us.â€

â€œMy dearest, you do not understand how troublesome two growing boys
could be. Your patience would very soon be exhausted.â€

â€œNo, indeed, Leon, for the patter of childrenâ€™s feet and the sound of
their happy voices would be like music in this great, lonely mansion.
Here we could care for them like our own children, and how happy it
would make our daughter when she comes home to find her loved little
cousins with us. Let me have my way in this, Leon, if you can feel
satisfied with the arrangements.â€

â€œSatisfied, my own love? Why, it will, indeed, be a boon to me for
which I shall feel grateful to you till my dying day,â€ he declared with
fervor.

And thus it happened that on the very next day Mark and Willie Lyndon
were removed from the dreary abode of poverty to their new palatial
home.

But the secret rage of Cora Ellyson at the turn affairs were taking can
better be imagined than described.

She had never felt a spark of real love for Mrs. Dalrymple, and had
contemplated her impending death with inward satisfaction, expecting to
inherit all her money, and rule royally in the social world by reason
of it.

It was a bitter blow when her aunt came back from the gates of death
and began to convalesce, but she reasoned to herself:

â€œIt is only a temporary improvement in health, for when her daughterâ€™s
fate continues to be unknown she will relapse into a worse stage than
at first, and die of disappointment.â€

But when Mrs. Dalrymple confided to her the new turn affairs had taken,
she could scarcely conceal her rage.

â€œYou are going to remarry your divorced husband--the man you deserted
of your own will, Aunt Verna, and pretended to hate and despise all
these years--Impossible!â€ she exclaimed remonstratingly.

Mrs. Dalrympleâ€™s dark head instantly crested itself with the pride Cora
knew so well, and she dared not find further fault.

So Cora, repulsed, could only vent her rage in secret, and bitter
enough it was, though mixed with one sweet drop of triumph in the
thought that never again would their eyes rest on Jessieâ€™s sweet face.

â€œLet them search and search, but never again will their eyes be
gladdened by her return. Let them go on believing that Cora Ellyson is
sorry she sent her into exile that night. Ha, ha!â€ and a laugh that was
fiendish in its cruel triumph rang out upon the stillness of the room.
She was in a retrospective mood, and as she shook loose the braids of
dark hair over her shoulder, she gazed fixedly at her pallid face in
the long mirror, muttering:

â€œYet Frank Laurier doesnâ€™t love me. How mortifying to marry a man who
shrinks from one with secret aversion! Yet I will not turn back. I will
marry him if only to punish him for his perfidy! And if he withholds
love then he shall feel to the core of his heart what it is to trample
on a womanâ€™s love!â€

Stung to fury by the indifference he could not hide, Cora was filled
with the venom of â€œa woman scorned.â€

  I will teach him to play with a rattlesnakeâ€™s tongue,
  I will teach him the tiger to rob of its young,
  I will teach him â€™twere better a man were unborn
  If the love of a proud-hearted woman he scorn.

The next day, after fitting out his manly little nephews in handsome
new clothing, Leon Dalrymple took them to their future home, where they
met a cordial welcome from the woman who was soon to be their uncleâ€™s
wife again.

But not so with Cora, who watched their movements with angry eyes.

To the little boys, fresh from the tiny cot of poverty, the great house
on Fifth Avenue was a wonderful Aladdinâ€™s palace.

They gazed about them in round-eyed wonder, and as soon as the first
sense of being company was over and they were left somewhat to their
own devices, they began to explore the house, peeping into room after
room with childish curiosity, mounting stairway after stairway, and
wandering along broad, dark corridors, until they could not find their
way back to the lower rooms where they had been left by Mrs. Dalrymple.

â€œIâ€™m losted,â€ sobbed Willie, the six-year-old, digging his little fists
into his tearful blue eyes.

â€œSo am I,â€ cried Mark, who was older and more manly; â€œbut donâ€™t cry!
Hereâ€™s another door! Letâ€™s peep in here!â€ seizing the knob, and shaking
it vigorously. But the lock refused to yield, and very suddenly he was
caught by Cora Ellyson, who slapped his face till his ears tingled with
pain.
