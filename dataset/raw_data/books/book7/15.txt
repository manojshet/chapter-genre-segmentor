A lonely life and much brooding inclines the mind to strange aspects.

Leon Dalrympleâ€™s thoughts dwelt persistently on the dead girl--his
divorced wifeâ€™s adopted daughter as he believed.

He felt a painful, almost jealous curiosity over her, wondering if she
had usurped the love that belonged to Jessie as well as her place in
her motherâ€™s home.

â€œI should like to look upon her face!â€ he repeated over and over to
himself, and the desire grew at last into a bold determination.

The early autumn twilight found him at the cemetery, whispering into
the ear of the feeble old sexton who recoiled with surprise at his
proposition:

â€œNo, sir, no, it would be as much as my place is worth! I canâ€™t do it!â€
he protested, but the clink of gold made him change his opinion.

â€œIt is nothing, after all--only to give me one look at the dead girlâ€™s
face! What could they do to you even if they discovered the truth?â€
Dalrymple repeated impatiently, and he redoubled his bribe.

The cupidity of the old man made him falter in his opposition, and as
a result they entered the vault just as the darkness of night settled
over the earth, the sexton carrying a dark lantern, whose glare he
turned on the bank of flowers that surrounded the casket, blending
their rich, rare odors with the noisome odors of mortality.

  The dead are in their silent graves,
  And the earth is cold above;
  And the living weep and sigh
  Over dust that once was love!

They advanced toward the casket, but suddenly each recoiled and glared
at the other.

â€œWhat was that? It sounded like a stifled moan!â€ exclaimed Dalrymple,
in alarm.

â€œNothing but the wind in the trees,â€ exclaimed the old sexton,
recovering himself, and wrenching loose the lid of the casket, sending
out gusts of rich fragrance from the covering of tuberoses.

A moment more, and the casket was open, Dalrymple advancing with a
quickened heartthrob to gaze on the silent sleeper.

It was a startling scene.

The old vault dark and grim, with rows of dead-and-gone aristocrats
ranged around, in the center the bier banked with flowers, supporting
the casket that held--not a dead girl, but a living one, for as the two
men gazed with bated breath on the exquisite face, a second low moan
sounded on the air, and then a pair of large, soft, wondering, dark
eyes opened suddenly, and gazed up into their startled faces!

It was enough to shake the nerves of the strongest man, to see the dead
thus suddenly come to life, and the old sexton was not strong--in fact,
he had suffered for years from an organic disease of the heart.

So the shock was more than his weak heart could bear.

His face changed to an ashen hue, his old eyes dilated wildly, his
frame shook like a leaf in the wind, his knees knocked together, and
finally, with an awful groan, he sank in a senseless heap on the floor
of the vault.

Dalrymple took no heed of the old manâ€™s fate. All his attention was
riveted on the girl struggling back to life from her place among the
dead.

It was no strange face that he gazed on, for years ago he had kissed a
fair, childish face with lineaments like these, as he placed the little
one in his tender sisterâ€™s arms, saying:

â€œCall her Jessie Lyndon, after yourself, dear, and train her up to be
noble and loving and true, as you have always been. I would not have
her brought up by her proud, rich, heartless mother, who deserted me
for my poverty, but rather as you have been, dear, to make a loving
wife to your husband through all reverses. I leave her in your care,
and I will send you ample money for her support, but Heaven alone knows
whether I shall ever return to the land where I have suffered such a
cruel shipwreck of my happiness.â€

That was twelve long years ago that he had wreaked what he believed
justifiable revenge on a heartless wife, goaded by ceaseless brooding
on his wrongs that had well-nigh turned his brain. Then he had exiled
himself from his native land and became a lonely wanderer.

  I go, but wheresoâ€™er I flee
  Thereâ€™s not an eye will weep for me.
  Thereâ€™s not a kind, congenial heart
  Where I may claim the smallest part.

He had but one solace, and that was in his art. Music had always been a
passion with him until love had become its rival. Now Cupid had fled,
he turned back to his old love. Drifting to Germany, he found congenial
friends, and for some years made a meager living for himself and child,
sending all he could spare to America for his golden-haired darling.

Then came that long, long illness that swallowed up almost a year of
his life in a hospital--that strange illness that baffled the learned
physicians, some declaring it was melancholy madness, others an
unaccountable loss of memory, but all agreeing that it must have been
brought about by long brooding over something that had become almost a
monomania.

  The whirlwind followed upon my brain and beat my thoughts to rack,
  Who knows how many a month I lay ere memory floated back?

When strength slowly returned and with it some glimmerings of painful
memory, a clever man, the wisest physician at the hospital, said to him:

â€œYou have been strangely ill, and the wisest among us could not rightly
name your disease, but it was next door to madness. I have studied your
case with keen interest, and I learn that you are a lonely man much
given to brooding and moping. Am I right in suspecting that you have a
hopeless sorrow hidden in your past?â€

Leon Dalrymple could only bend his blond, curly head in silent assent.

â€œI knew it,â€ said the wise physician, and he added kindly:

â€œCease brooding over this ill that you cannot remedy, for that way
madness lies. Forgetfulness is the only panacea for a hopeless grief.
You are a musician, they tell me. Give it up for a more practical
life. The greatest bard in the world has written that music is the
food of love. Thus it only ministers to your sorrow. Cast it aside for
a totally different life. If you were strong enough, I should say try
manual labor, that in exhausting the body, dulls and wearies the mind,
curing its ills of brooding and melancholy. Try the Australian gold
fields. Get rich and practical.â€

The patient took his advice.

After years of toil and travel, when body and mind were both restored,
he had permitted himself to dwell again with yearning memory on the
past.

He was aghast when he counted up twelve years since he had come away.

â€œI must go home to my little Jessie!â€ he cried.

He had kissed her as a child and gone away--he found her again almost
a woman, lying among funeral flowers in her soft, white shroud, but,
thank Heaven, with the breath of life faintly heaving her bosom, and
dawning in the dark of her tender eyes.

â€œJessie, Jessie!â€ he cried, in a transport of joy, but she knew him
not; her glance was dazed and frightened at her grim, unfamiliar
surroundings.

It came to him suddenly that if she recovered consciousness fully and
found she had been buried alive the shock might be too great for her
reason.

She had closed her eyes again with a tired sigh, so he lifted her
tenderly from her white satin bed, and bearing her outside, wrapped her
carefully in his long, dark overcoat.
