The days flew fast and to-morrow their eventful journey would be
over--they would land at New York.

More than one heart was secretly sorry, grieving to lose sight of one
sweet passenger--lovely Jessie Lyndon.

And what made the parting worse was that Jessie gave them no hope
of meeting her again, in spite of their broad hints at renewing her
acquaintance in New York.

She had said to one and all that she was going to relatives in the
city, but not to any one, even Laurier, did she disclose their names.

In fact, Jessie was ill at ease over the thought of returning to her
mother, because there she must meet again the proud beauty, Cora.

â€œI must be there through all the excitement of their wedding. How can I
bear it?â€ she asked herself in frank dismay.

It seemed to her that she could not bear the pain of seeing him wedded
to another. She would be sure to turn pale and tremble, and thus betray
the secret of her sad heart--her unrequited love.

She wished that the wedding were over and done with, so that they might
be gone away on their bridal tour before she entered the house.

The more she thought of it the more she felt that she could not bear
the excitement of the wedding, and at length she resolved to seek out
some of her former humble friends and remain with them until Laurier
and his bride were gone on their wedding tour.

That last night before they landed was the most beautiful they had
experienced. The azure dome was gemmed with countless stars that were
mirrored in the calm sea, the moon shed a bewitching, silvery light on
everything, and the air was as soft as in midsummer.

Every one remained on deck till a late hour. They had music and
flirting to beguile the time, and Laurier betrayed the fact of Jessieâ€™s
talent.

â€œOh, why did you not tell us before?â€ they cried. â€œOh, do not refuse to
sing for us!â€

They had been so kind that she could not well refuse; besides, she
loved to sing as the birds love to warble.

She whispered to Laurier:

â€œI will do my best because they have all been so kind to me, but I fear
I shall break down thinking of poor papa and the uncertainty of his
fate.â€

He tried to cheer her with hopeful words:

â€œLook on the bright side; your father may have been saved just as we
were, and you may soon be reunited.â€

â€œI fear not. He had a presentiment of death, I believe, for he sent
messages as from the dying to his friends in New York,â€ she sighed.

â€œStill, I would not give up hope. Many people have been known to
survive terrible accidents,â€ he replied, and she wondered if he was
thinking of all that had happened to him and Cora.

She sighed, and began to strum softly on the guitar some one had
offered for her accompaniments.

Then she sang, and the tremor in her voice made it all the sweeter.
They hung spellbound on the liquid notes sweet as the nightingale.

â€œIt is another Melba!â€ they cried in delight, but some were hushed into
silence, their very heartstrings stirred by the divine strains.

When she stopped at last, all were clamorous for more, but she pleaded
weariness.

A low voice murmured in her ear:

â€œJust one more, please--the song you sang for your father the night I
first saw you.â€

â€œI must have sung several,â€ she replied, and he answered:

â€œâ€˜Love, I will love you ever!â€™â€

The significant earnestness of the tone and words made her heart throb
so quickly that the blood mantled her cheek with crimson. She made no
answer, just swept the strings and sang the sweet old song, while his
heart kept echoing the tender refrain:

  â€œLove, I will love you ever,
  Love, I will leave you never,
  Faithful and true,
  Ever to me precious to be,
  Heart bound to heart,
  Never to part,
  Love, I will love you ever!â€

She paused, and no one ventured to ask her to sing again. They wished
to keep the last sweet strain in their hearts.

She turned her face up to the starry sky, and little by little they
fell away from her side, comprehending that she preferred to be alone.

Soon no one was left but Laurier, and for some little time he kept
silence. It was enough to be near her, to gaze on the lovely face
upturned to the moonlit sky, to breathe the same air with her, and to
wonder of what she was thinking with that pensive curve on her crimson
lips, whether of her dead father, or a possible lover.

He started while a twinge of jealousy tore through his heart like
red-hot iron. A lover! Oh, how he hated the thought!

Then another thought came to vex him.

To-morrow they would be parted. She was going out of his life to
unknown friends.

And she had shown no disposition to continue her acquaintance with him
beyond to-morrow.

Could he bear to lose her thus?

Life would be unutterably dreary without this beautiful girl who had
come into his life so strangely, and was about to fade from it so soon.

His heart leaped with great, suffocating throbs. He must speak, must
know his fate!

He leaned closer to her till their heads almost touched, the brown,
curly one, and the wavy, golden-tressed one.

â€œJessie,â€ he faltered.

She started violently, and turned her face inquiringly toward him, as
he continued:

â€œEver since that first night I saw you with your pure face upturned
to the sky, the words of your song have echoed in my heart. Will you
forgive me for daring to say them over to you? â€˜Love, I will love you
ever!â€™â€

She could not pretend to misunderstand him. With dilated, wondering
eyes, she gazed at him, as he continued thrillingly:

â€œI know this seems strange to you--strange and abrupt. But once before
I knew and loved a Jessie Lyndon, so like to you that you might have
been twin sisters. Perhaps you have had a near relative of that name?â€
anxiously.
