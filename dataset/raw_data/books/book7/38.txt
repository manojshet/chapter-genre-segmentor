Cora had been listening outside the door, and she darted in now,
exclaiming:

â€œI was just coming in when I heard you call for me, dear aunt.â€

She gazed at Carey Doyle as if he had been a perfect stranger, but her
face was ghastly with fear lest he meant also to betray her secret.

But he flashed her a swift, reassuring look while Mrs. Dalrymple
exclaimed:

â€œOnly think, Cora, this man has news of Darling. Kindly repeat it to
her, sir.â€

And Carey Doyle, who remembered well the rivalry between Cora and
Jessie, took a malicious pleasure in doing so, gloating over each word
as he saw how ghastly pale and frightened she grew.

Mrs. Dalrymple was watching her niece, too, and very suddenly she said:

â€œWhile he was telling me this story, Cora, I remembered that on
that same night a servant called you out of my room, saying a young
lady wanted me, and that you must come down. You went, and when
you returned, after a while, you said nothing of the visitor, and
in my agitation I forgot it till just now. Cora, Cora, can it be
possibleâ€--she broke off short, for Cora fell at her feet in wildest
agitation.

â€œOh, Aunt Verna, can you ever forgive me for what I have done? Indeed,
I meant it for the best, but it has turned out to be a terrible
mistake!â€

â€œCora, Cora, what have you done?â€

â€œForgive me, forgive me; I did wrong.â€

â€œDo not keep me in suspense, Cora. Answer me, was it my daughter that
came that night?â€

â€œIt was a girl that looked like the one you interred in the old family
vault. She said: â€˜I am Jessie Lyndon, the stolen daughter of Mrs.
Dalrymple. I wish to see her if you please!â€™â€

â€œMy God! And you sent her away?â€ groaned the agonized mother.

â€œYes, I sent her away, for how could I dream that she was speaking the
truth?â€

â€œCora, you should have brought her to me!â€ wildly.

â€œI feared it would kill you in your weak state, for every one thought
you were sinking into death. It seemed to me I was acting very
prudently, and when she was gone I kept the secret, believing it was
for the best.â€

Coraâ€™s acting was superb. Her dark eyes were full of burning tears, and
her whole behavior showed grief and regret.

Mrs. Dalrymple was completely deceived. She almost pitied Cora.

â€œGet up, dear girl, do not weep so bitterly. I will forgive you, for I
know you did what you thought was for the best, though you made a sad
and grievous mistake.â€

She turned her eyes on Carey Doyle as if she had momentarily forgotten
his presence, and exclaimed:

â€œWhy, have you not seen the chauffeur who brought her here?â€

â€œI did not neglect that, madam, but he said she paid her fare and
dismissed him, saying she should remain with her friends all night.â€

â€œOh, heavens, what a mystery! Where did my Darling go, alone,
penniless, friendless, that gloomy night?â€ sobbed the mother.

Carey Doyle watched Cora with a lynx eye, but her perfectly acted
remorse and grief baffled suspicion.

He rose, and Mrs. Dalrymple said eagerly:

â€œKeep up the search for my daughter and you shall be paid well for your
work.â€

â€œI will do what I can, madam, and I hope you will hear from me again,â€
he replied respectfully; then with a malignant look at Cora, he
withdrew from the room and was shown out by a servant.

       *       *       *       *       *

Cora had a difficult rÃ´le to play now, pretending the keenest regret
for her cousinâ€™s disappearance, while at heart she was wildly elated
over it.

But she was not finding much happiness in her position as bride elect,
though she knew that half the girls in New York would envy her the
honor of becoming the handsome young millionaireâ€™s bride.

They did not know how she had schemed and sinned for that honor, nor
that the sweets of victory had turned to dead sea fruit upon her lips.

His short-lived passion was dead, and in spite of his honorable efforts
to disguise his indifference, Cora realized his patient misery, and
knew that the day of their wedding was secretly unwelcome to his heart.

A nobler woman would have given him his freedom unasked, too proud to
accept the hand without the heart.

Not so Cora, who recklessly ran every risk for the sake of gratifying
her love and ambition, hurrying on the wedding day in spite of her
auntâ€™s lingering illness and painful anxiety, and despite the fact that
she knew that secretly Frank resented the unseemly haste.

Indeed, she had overheard him lamenting it to Mrs. Dalrymple, saying:

â€œI fear it looks selfish to you, our marrying and going off in such
haste, leaving you in this trouble.â€

â€œDo not think of me. Cora is the only one to be considered now. She
feels that she has waited too long for her happiness to have it
postponed longer,â€ she answered.

He noticed that she made no reference to his own case, and flushed
slightly, dreading lest she had penetrated the secret of his love for
her missing daughter, and meant to rebuke him for fickleness to Cora.

He said no more, for Cora entered just then with a downcast face,
having managed to overhear their brief conversation. They were going
for a drive, and presently Mrs. Dalrymple was left alone with her
thoughts.

They were not pleasant ones, for they veered with painful persistence
between the missing daughter and the dead father.

In the dear, dead past she had loved him well, and the old love seemed
to wake again, now that he was dead and beyond her tenderness.

  So often since you went away,
    I wonder in a vain despair,
  If you are sad, if you are glad,
    And if you miss me there!

  Do you recall impatient words
    Full of lifeâ€™s jar and pain?
  Oh, I would take them back, dear heart,
    If you could come again!

She leaned her beautiful, dark head on her wasted, white hand where the
blue veins showed so clearly, and burning tears flowed down her cheeks.

Suzanne entered with the afternoon mail on a salver, placed it on a
stand before her mistress, and gently retired.

Dashing away the unwelcome tears, she began going over the letters,
mostly affectionate missives from her â€œdear Four Hundred friends,â€
expressing affectionate pleasure at her rumored great improvement in
health.

Dropping them wearily one after the other, she came upon one addressed
in so large a masculine hand that she stared at it in some curiosity.

Then she saw that it was not addressed to herself, but to Miss Darling
Dalrymple, and was postmarked New York.

â€œHow very, very strange this is, and how familiar the handwriting
looks!â€ she cried with a quickened heartthrob, and she decided that in
this case it was her duty to open her daughterâ€™s letter.

She did so with nervous, fluttering fingers, and then she saw staring
her in the face these words:

  â€œMY DARLING DAUGHTER: If I had not thought I was destined to perish in
  the cruel sea that day, I should never have given you the clew to find
  your proud mother who wrecked my life with her relentless scorn.

  â€œIf I had not been sure of death, I never should have intrusted you
  with those messages of remorse and forgiveness and love at which she
  laughed, perhaps, in her undying resentment against me. I could hope
  now that you forgot to tell her, for it might be better so.

  â€œYou are with your mother, no doubt, so I address this letter to her
  house. Oh, Jessie, darling, how I blundered when I gave you back to
  her! My heart cries out for you, my darling child, the only treasure
  I have in the world! I cannot give you up. Will you come back to me,
  darling? She has troops of friends, and does not need you, but I have
  only my dark-eyed Jessie.

  â€œIf she laughed and mocked at the tender messages I sent her when I
  believed I must die, never tell me of it, darling. I cannot bear the
  pain.

  â€œChoose between us, quickly, Jessie, and come to me at once, if you
  can, at the Hotel Supremacy.

  â€œLEON DALRYMPLE.â€

The great, hollow, dark eyes devoured every word with surprise and joy,
for nothing he could say against her mattered much now that she knew he
lived, the man she had loved hopelessly through years of alienation and
separation with the terrible barrier of divorce between their wedded
hearts.

And no matter how far they had drifted apart, their hearts must share
one common sorrow--the loss of their darling.

She bowed her head upon the letter, and the wild, hysterical sobs of an
overburdened heart shook her frame.
