Mr. Sherlock Holmes


      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,
      save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all
      night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the
      hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left
      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,
      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a â€œPenang lawyer.â€
      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
      across. â€œTo James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
      C.C.H.,â€ was engraved upon it, with the date â€œ1884.â€ It was just
      such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to
      carryâ€”dignified, solid, and reassuring.

      â€œWell, Watson, what do you make of it?â€

      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no
      sign of my occupation.

      â€œHow did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in
      the back of your head.â€

      â€œI have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in
      front of me,â€ said he. â€œBut, tell me, Watson, what do you make of
      our visitorâ€™s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss
      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir
      becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an
      examination of it.â€

      â€œI think,â€ said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
      companion, â€œthat Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical
      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of
      their appreciation.â€

      â€œGood!â€ said Holmes. â€œExcellent!â€

      â€œI think also that the probability is in favour of his being a
      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on
      foot.â€

      â€œWhy so?â€

      â€œBecause this stick, though originally a very handsome one has
      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town
      practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so
      it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with
      it.â€

      â€œPerfectly sound!â€ said Holmes.

      â€œAnd then again, there is the â€˜friends of the C.C.H.â€™ I should
      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose
      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which
      has made him a small presentation in return.â€

      â€œReally, Watson, you excel yourself,â€ said Holmes, pushing back
      his chair and lighting a cigarette. â€œI am bound to say that in
      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own
      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own
      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you
      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius
      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear
      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.â€

      He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words
      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his
      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had
      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think
      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way
      which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands
      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with
      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and
      carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a
      convex lens.

      â€œInteresting, though elementary,â€ said he as he returned to his
      favourite corner of the settee. â€œThere are certainly one or two
      indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
      deductions.â€

      â€œHas anything escaped me?â€ I asked with some self-importance. â€œI
      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have
      overlooked?â€

      â€œI am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be
      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided
      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this
      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he
      walks a good deal.â€

      â€œThen I was right.â€

      â€œTo that extent.â€

      â€œBut that was all.â€

      â€œNo, no, my dear Watson, not allâ€”by no means all. I would
      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more
      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when
      the initials â€˜C.C.â€™ are placed before that hospital the words
      â€˜Charing Crossâ€™ very naturally suggest themselves.â€

      â€œYou may be right.â€

      â€œThe probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
      construction of this unknown visitor.â€

      â€œWell, then, supposing that â€˜C.C.H.â€™ does stand for â€˜Charing
      Cross Hospital,â€™ what further inferences may we draw?â€

      â€œDo none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!â€

      â€œI can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has
      practised in town before going to the country.â€

      â€œI think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look
      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable
      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends
      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the
      moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the
      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there
      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from
      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching
      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
      occasion of the change?â€

      â€œIt certainly seems probable.â€

      â€œNow, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_
      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London
      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not
      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the
      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a
      house-surgeon or a house-physicianâ€”little more than a senior
      student. And he left five years agoâ€”the date is on the stick. So
      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin
      air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under
      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of
      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger
      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.â€

      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his
      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

      â€œAs to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,â€ said I,
      â€œbut at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars
      about the manâ€™s age and professional career.â€ From my small
      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the
      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our
      visitor. I read his record aloud.

        â€œMortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with
        essay entitled â€˜Is Disease a Reversion?â€™  Corresponding member
        of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of â€˜Some Freaks of
        Atavismâ€™ (_Lancet_ 1882).  â€˜Do We Progress?â€™ (_Journal of
        Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of
        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.â€

      â€œNo mention of that local hunt, Watson,â€ said Holmes with a
      mischievous smile, â€œbut a country doctor, as you very astutely
      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As
      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,
      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is
      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only
      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,
      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.â€

      â€œAnd the dog?â€

      â€œHas been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.
      Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,
      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dogâ€™s
      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in
      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It
      may have beenâ€”yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.â€

      He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the
      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his
      voice that I glanced up in surprise.

      â€œMy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?â€

      â€œFor the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our
      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Donâ€™t move, I
      beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your
      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment
      of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is
      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.
      What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock
      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!â€

      The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had
      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin
      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two
      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from
      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a
      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was
      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was
      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes
      fell upon the stick in Holmesâ€™s hand, and he ran towards it with
      an exclamation of joy. â€œI am so very glad,â€ said he. â€œI was not
      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I
      would not lose that stick for the world.â€

      â€œA presentation, I see,â€ said Holmes.

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œFrom Charing Cross Hospital?â€

      â€œFrom one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.â€

      â€œDear, dear, thatâ€™s bad!â€ said Holmes, shaking his head.

      Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.
      â€œWhy was it bad?â€

      â€œOnly that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your
      marriage, you say?â€

      â€œYes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all
      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home
      of my own.â€

      â€œCome, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,â€ said Holmes.
      â€œAnd now, Dr. James Mortimerâ€”â€

      â€œMister, sir, Misterâ€”a humble M.R.C.S.â€

      â€œAnd a man of precise mind, evidently.â€

      â€œA dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the
      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and notâ€”â€

      â€œNo, this is my friend Dr. Watson.â€

      â€œGlad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in
      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,
      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or
      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any
      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A
      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would
      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my
      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.â€

      Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. â€œYou are
      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am
      in mine,â€ said he. â€œI observe from your forefinger that you make
      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.â€

      The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the
      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers
      as agile and restless as the antennÃ¦ of an insect.

      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the
      interest which he took in our curious companion. â€œI presume,
      sir,â€ said he at last, â€œthat it was not merely for the purpose of
      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here
      last night and again today?â€

      â€œNo, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of
      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I
      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am
      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary
      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest
      expert in Europeâ€”â€

      â€œIndeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?â€
      asked Holmes with some asperity.

      â€œTo the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur
      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.â€

      â€œThen had you not better consult him?â€

      â€œI said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a
      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.
      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertentlyâ€”â€

      â€œJust a little,â€ said Holmes. â€œI think, Dr. Mortimer, you would
      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly
      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my
      assistance.â€
