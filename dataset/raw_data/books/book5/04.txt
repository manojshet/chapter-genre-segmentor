Sir Henry Baskerville


      Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
      dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were
      punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten
      when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.
      The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years
      of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a
      strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and
      had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of
      his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his
      steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
      the gentleman.

      â€œThis is Sir Henry Baskerville,â€ said Dr. Mortimer.

      â€œWhy, yes,â€ said he, â€œand the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to
      you this morning I should have come on my own account. I
      understand that you think out little puzzles, and Iâ€™ve had one
      this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give
      it.â€

      â€œPray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
      have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
      London?â€

      â€œNothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as
      not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which
      reached me this morning.â€

      He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It
      was of common quality, greyish in colour. The address, â€œSir Henry
      Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,â€ was printed in rough
      characters; the post-mark â€œCharing Cross,â€ and the date of
      posting the preceding evening.

      â€œWho knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?â€ asked
      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

      â€œNo one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.
      Mortimer.â€

      â€œBut Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?â€

      â€œNo, I had been staying with a friend,â€ said the doctor.

      â€œThere was no possible indication that we intended to go to this
      hotel.â€

      â€œHum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your
      movements.â€ Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap
      paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the
      table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed
      by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

      The word â€œmoorâ€ only was printed in ink.

      â€œNow,â€ said Sir Henry Baskerville, â€œperhaps you will tell me, Mr.
      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is
      that takes so much interest in my affairs?â€

      â€œWhat do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there
      is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?â€

      â€œNo, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was
      convinced that the business is supernatural.â€

      â€œWhat business?â€ asked Sir Henry sharply. â€œIt seems to me that
      all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own
      affairs.â€

      â€œYou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir
      Henry. I promise you that,â€ said Sherlock Holmes. â€œWe will
      confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this
      very interesting document, which must have been put together and
      posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterdayâ€™s _Times_, Watson?â€

      â€œIt is here in the corner.â€

      â€œMight I trouble you for itâ€”the inside page, please, with the
      leading articles?â€ He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes
      up and down the columns. â€œCapital article this on free trade.
      Permit me to give you an extract from it.

     â€˜You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but
     it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run
     keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our
     imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.â€™

      â€œWhat do you think of that, Watson?â€ cried Holmes in high glee,
      rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. â€œDonâ€™t you think
      that is an admirable sentiment?â€

      Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional
      interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark
      eyes upon me.

      â€œI donâ€™t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,â€
      said he, â€œbut it seems to me weâ€™ve got a bit off the trail so far
      as that note is concerned.â€

      â€œOn the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail,
      Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do,
      but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of
      this sentence.â€

      â€œNo, I confess that I see no connection.â€

      â€œAnd yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection
      that the one is extracted out of the other. â€˜You,â€™ â€˜your,â€™
      â€˜your,â€™ â€˜life,â€™ â€˜reason,â€™ â€˜value,â€™ â€˜keep away,â€™ â€˜from the.â€™ Donâ€™t
      you see now whence these words have been taken?â€

      â€œBy thunder, youâ€™re right! Well, if that isnâ€™t smart!â€ cried Sir
      Henry.

      â€œIf any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that
      â€˜keep awayâ€™ and â€˜from theâ€™ are cut out in one piece.â€

      â€œWell, nowâ€”so it is!â€

      â€œReally, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have
      imagined,â€ said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement.
      â€œI could understand anyone saying that the words were from a
      newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came
      from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable
      things which I have ever known. How did you do it?â€

      â€œI presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from
      that of an Esquimau?â€

      â€œMost certainly.â€

      â€œBut how?â€

      â€œBecause that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious.
      The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,
      theâ€”â€

      â€œBut this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
      obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the
      leaded bourgeois type of a _Times_ article and the slovenly print
      of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your
      negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the
      most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in
      crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
      confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But
      a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could
      have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the
      strong probability was that we should find the words in
      yesterdayâ€™s issue.â€

      â€œSo far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,â€ said Sir Henry
      Baskerville, â€œsomeone cut out this message with a scissorsâ€”â€

      â€œNail-scissors,â€ said Holmes. â€œYou can see that it was a very
      short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips
      over â€˜keep away.â€™â€

      â€œThat is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
      short-bladed scissors, pasted it with pasteâ€”â€

      â€œGum,â€ said Holmes.

      â€œWith gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word â€˜moorâ€™
      should have been written?â€

      â€œBecause he could not find it in print. The other words were all
      simple and might be found in any issue, but â€˜moorâ€™ would be less
      common.â€

      â€œWhy, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything
      else in this message, Mr. Holmes?â€

      â€œThere are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have
      been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is
      printed in rough characters. But the _Times_ is a paper which is
      seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We
      may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an
      educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his
      effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing
      might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will
      observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but
      that some are much higher than others. â€˜Life,â€™ for example is
      quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or
      it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.
      On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was
      evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such
      a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the
      interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
      letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
      would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruptionâ€”and
      from whom?â€

      â€œWe are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,â€ said Dr.
      Mortimer.

      â€œSay, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
      choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the
      imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to
      start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt,
      but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a
      hotel.â€

      â€œHow in the world can you say that?â€

      â€œIf you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and
      the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered
      twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short
      address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.
      Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such
      a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But
      you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get
      anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that
      could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around
      Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated _Times_
      leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent
      this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! Whatâ€™s this?â€

      He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words
      were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.

      â€œWell?â€

      â€œNothing,â€ said he, throwing it down. â€œIt is a blank half-sheet
      of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have
      drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir
      Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you
      have been in London?â€

      â€œWhy, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.â€

      â€œYou have not observed anyone follow or watch you?â€

      â€œI seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,â€
      said our visitor. â€œWhy in thunder should anyone follow or watch
      me?â€

      â€œWe are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us
      before we go into this matter?â€

      â€œWell, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.â€

      â€œI think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
      reporting.â€

      Sir Henry smiled. â€œI donâ€™t know much of British life yet, for I
      have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I
      hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary
      routine of life over here.â€

      â€œYou have lost one of your boots?â€

      â€œMy dear sir,â€ cried Dr. Mortimer, â€œit is only mislaid. You will
      find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of
      troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?â€

      â€œWell, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.â€

      â€œExactly,â€ said Holmes, â€œhowever foolish the incident may seem.
      You have lost one of your boots, you say?â€

      â€œWell, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last
      night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no
      sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I
      only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never
      had them on.â€

      â€œIf you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be
      cleaned?â€

      â€œThey were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I
      put them out.â€

      â€œThen I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you
      went out at once and bought a pair of boots?â€

      â€œI did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with
      me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the
      part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways
      out West. Among other things I bought these brown bootsâ€”gave six
      dollars for themâ€”and had one stolen before ever I had them on my
      feet.â€

      â€œIt seems a singularly useless thing to steal,â€ said Sherlock
      Holmes. â€œI confess that I share Dr. Mortimerâ€™s belief that it
      will not be long before the missing boot is found.â€

      â€œAnd, now, gentlemen,â€ said the baronet with decision, â€œit seems
      to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I
      know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full
      account of what we are all driving at.â€

      â€œYour request is a very reasonable one,â€ Holmes answered. â€œDr.
      Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story
      as you told it to us.â€

      Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his
      pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the
      morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest
      attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.

      â€œWell, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,â€
      said he when the long narrative was finished. â€œOf course, Iâ€™ve
      heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. Itâ€™s the pet
      story of the family, though I never thought of taking it
      seriously before. But as to my uncleâ€™s deathâ€”well, it all seems
      boiling up in my head, and I canâ€™t get it clear yet. You donâ€™t
      seem quite to have made up your mind whether itâ€™s a case for a
      policeman or a clergyman.â€

      â€œPrecisely.â€

      â€œAnd now thereâ€™s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I
      suppose that fits into its place.â€

      â€œIt seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what
      goes on upon the moor,â€ said Dr. Mortimer.

      â€œAnd also,â€ said Holmes, â€œthat someone is not ill-disposed
      towards you, since they warn you of danger.â€

      â€œOr it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me
      away.â€

      â€œWell, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted
      to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which
      presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical
      point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or
      is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.â€

      â€œWhy should I not go?â€

      â€œThere seems to be danger.â€

      â€œDo you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger
      from human beings?â€

      â€œWell, that is what we have to find out.â€

      â€œWhichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell,
      Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me
      from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to
      be my final answer.â€ His dark brows knitted and his face flushed
      to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper
      of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last
      representative. â€œMeanwhile,â€ said he, â€œI have hardly had time to
      think over all that you have told me. Itâ€™s a big thing for a man
      to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like
      to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look
      here, Mr. Holmes, itâ€™s half-past eleven now and I am going back
      right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson,
      come round and lunch with us at two. Iâ€™ll be able to tell you
      more clearly then how this thing strikes me.â€

      â€œIs that convenient to you, Watson?â€

      â€œPerfectly.â€

      â€œThen you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?â€

      â€œIâ€™d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.â€

      â€œIâ€™ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,â€ said his companion.

      â€œThen we meet again at two oâ€™clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!â€

      We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang
      of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the
      languid dreamer to the man of action.

      â€œYour hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!â€ He
      rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a
      few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs
      and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still
      visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of
      Oxford Street.

      â€œShall I run on and stop them?â€

      â€œNot for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with
      your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for
      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.â€

      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which
      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards
      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.
      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon
      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little
      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager
      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted
      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward
      again.

      â€œThereâ€™s our man, Watson! Come along! Weâ€™ll have a good look at
      him, if we can do no more.â€

      At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
      piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
      Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed
      to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street.
      Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in
      sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the
      traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out
      of sight.

      â€œThere now!â€ said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white
      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. â€œWas ever such bad luck
      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an
      honest man you will record this also and set it against my
      successes!â€

      â€œWho was the man?â€

      â€œI have not an idea.â€

      â€œA spy?â€

      â€œWell, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville
      has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in
      town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the
      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed
      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the
      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the
      window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.â€

      â€œYes, I remember.â€

      â€œI was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.
      We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very
      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is
      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I
      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I
      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their
      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted
      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he
      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.
      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take
      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one
      obvious disadvantage.â€

      â€œIt puts him in the power of the cabman.â€

      â€œExactly.â€

      â€œWhat a pity we did not get the number!â€

      â€œMy dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not
      seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is
      our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.â€

      â€œI fail to see how you could have done more.â€

      â€œOn observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked
      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a
      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,
      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited
      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should
      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and
      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,
      which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and
      energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our
      man.â€

      We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
      conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long
      vanished in front of us.

      â€œThere is no object in our following them,â€ said Holmes. â€œThe
      shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further
      cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you
      swear to that manâ€™s face within the cab?â€

      â€œI could swear only to the beard.â€

      â€œAnd so could Iâ€”from which I gather that in all probability it
      was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no
      use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,
      Watson!â€

      He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he
      was warmly greeted by the manager.

      â€œAh, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in
      which I had the good fortune to help you?â€

      â€œNo, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps
      my life.â€

      â€œMy dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,
      Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who
      showed some ability during the investigation.â€

      â€œYes, sir, he is still with us.â€

      â€œCould you ring him up?â€”thank you! And I should be glad to have
      change of this five-pound note.â€

      A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the
      summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence
      at the famous detective.

      â€œLet me have the Hotel Directory,â€ said Holmes. â€œThank you! Now,
      Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all
      in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œYou will visit each of these in turn.â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œYou will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one
      shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œYou will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of
      yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried
      and that you are looking for it. You understand?â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œBut what you are really looking for is the centre page of the
      _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy
      of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,
      could you not?â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œIn each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,
      to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three
      shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of
      the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned
      or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of
      paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.
      The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten
      shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by
      wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
      remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,
      No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street
      picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the
      hotel.â€
