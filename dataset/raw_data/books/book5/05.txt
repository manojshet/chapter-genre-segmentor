Three Broken Threads


      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of
      detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in
      which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was
      entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.
      He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest
      ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at
      the Northumberland Hotel.

      â€œSir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,â€ said the
      clerk. â€œHe asked me to show you up at once when you came.â€

      â€œHave you any objection to my looking at your register?â€ said
      Holmes.

      â€œNot in the least.â€

      The book showed that two names had been added after that of
      Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;
      the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.

      â€œSurely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,â€ said
      Holmes to the porter. â€œA lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and
      walks with a limp?â€

      â€œNo, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active
      gentleman, not older than yourself.â€

      â€œSurely you are mistaken about his trade?â€

      â€œNo, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very
      well known to us.â€

      â€œAh, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the
      name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend
      one finds another.â€

      â€œShe is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of
      Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.â€

      â€œThank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have
      established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,â€ he
      continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. â€œWe know
      now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not
      settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as
      we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious
      that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive
      fact.â€

      â€œWhat does it suggest?â€

      â€œIt suggestsâ€”halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the
      matter?â€

      As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir
      Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and
      he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was
      he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in
      a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had
      heard from him in the morning.

      â€œSeems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,â€ he
      cried. â€œTheyâ€™ll find theyâ€™ve started in to monkey with the wrong
      man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap canâ€™t find
      my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the
      best, Mr. Holmes, but theyâ€™ve got a bit over the mark this time.â€

      â€œStill looking for your boot?â€

      â€œYes, sir, and mean to find it.â€

      â€œBut, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?â€

      â€œSo it was, sir. And now itâ€™s an old black one.â€

      â€œWhat! you donâ€™t mean to sayâ€”?â€

      â€œThatâ€™s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the
      worldâ€”the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,
      which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,
      and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got
      it? Speak out, man, and donâ€™t stand staring!â€

      An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.

      â€œNo, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear
      no word of it.â€

      â€œWell, either that boot comes back before sundown or Iâ€™ll see the
      manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.â€

      â€œIt shall be found, sirâ€”I promise you that if you will have a
      little patience it will be found.â€

      â€œMind it is, for itâ€™s the last thing of mine that Iâ€™ll lose in
      this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, youâ€™ll excuse my
      troubling you about such a trifleâ€”â€

      â€œI think itâ€™s well worth troubling about.â€

      â€œWhy, you look very serious over it.â€

      â€œHow do you explain it?â€

      â€œI just donâ€™t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,
      queerest thing that ever happened to me.â€

      â€œThe queerest perhapsâ€”â€ said Holmes thoughtfully.

      â€œWhat do you make of it yourself?â€

      â€œWell, I donâ€™t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours
      is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your
      uncleâ€™s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of
      capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts
      so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds
      are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may
      waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we
      must come upon the right.â€

      We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the
      business which had brought us together. It was in the private
      sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked
      Baskerville what were his intentions.

      â€œTo go to Baskerville Hall.â€

      â€œAnd when?â€

      â€œAt the end of the week.â€

      â€œOn the whole,â€ said Holmes, â€œI think that your decision is a
      wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in
      London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult
      to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If
      their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we
      should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.
      Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?â€

      Dr. Mortimer started violently. â€œFollowed! By whom?â€

      â€œThat, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among
      your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a
      black, full beard?â€

      â€œNoâ€”or, let me seeâ€”why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charlesâ€™s butler, is
      a man with a full, black beard.â€

      â€œHa! Where is Barrymore?â€

      â€œHe is in charge of the Hall.â€

      â€œWe had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any
      possibility he might be in London.â€

      â€œHow can you do that?â€

      â€œGive me a telegraph form. â€˜Is all ready for Sir Henry?â€™ That
      will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the
      nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a
      second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: â€˜Telegram to Mr.
      Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please
      return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.â€™ That
      should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his
      post in Devonshire or not.â€

      â€œThatâ€™s so,â€ said Baskerville. â€œBy the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is
      this Barrymore, anyhow?â€

      â€œHe is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have
      looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,
      he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the
      county.â€

      â€œAt the same time,â€ said Baskerville, â€œitâ€™s clear enough that so
      long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people
      have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.â€

      â€œThat is true.â€

      â€œDid Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charlesâ€™s will?â€ asked
      Holmes.

      â€œHe and his wife had five hundred pounds each.â€

      â€œHa! Did they know that they would receive this?â€

      â€œYes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions
      of his will.â€

      â€œThat is very interesting.â€

      â€œI hope,â€ said Dr. Mortimer, â€œthat you do not look with
      suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir
      Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.â€

      â€œIndeed! And anyone else?â€

      â€œThere were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large
      number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.â€

      â€œAnd how much was the residue?â€

      â€œSeven hundred and forty thousand pounds.â€

      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. â€œI had no idea that so
      gigantic a sum was involved,â€ said he.

      â€œSir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not
      know how very rich he was until we came to examine his
      securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a
      million.â€

      â€œDear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a
      desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing
      that anything happened to our young friend hereâ€”you will forgive
      the unpleasant hypothesis!â€”who would inherit the estate?â€

      â€œSince Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charlesâ€™s younger brother died
      unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are
      distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in
      Westmoreland.â€

      â€œThank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met
      Mr. James Desmond?â€

      â€œYes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of
      venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he
      refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he
      pressed it upon him.â€

      â€œAnd this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charlesâ€™s
      thousands.â€

      â€œHe would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He
      would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed
      otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he
      likes with it.â€

      â€œAnd have you made your will, Sir Henry?â€

      â€œNo, Mr. Holmes, I have not. Iâ€™ve had no time, for it was only
      yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I
      feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was
      my poor uncleâ€™s idea. How is the owner going to restore the
      glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up
      the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.â€

      â€œQuite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the
      advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.
      There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must
      not go alone.â€

      â€œDr. Mortimer returns with me.â€

      â€œBut Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is
      miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may
      be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you
      someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.â€

      â€œIs it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?â€

      â€œIf matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in
      person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting
      practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many
      quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an
      indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered
      names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I
      can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is
      for me to go to Dartmoor.â€

      â€œWhom would you recommend, then?â€

      Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. â€œIf my friend would undertake
      it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when
      you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than
      I.â€

      The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had
      time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it
      heartily.

      â€œWell, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,â€ said he. â€œYou
      see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter
      as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me
      through Iâ€™ll never forget it.â€

      The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I
      was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with
      which the baronet hailed me as a companion.

      â€œI will come, with pleasure,â€ said I. â€œI do not know how I could
      employ my time better.â€

      â€œAnd you will report very carefully to me,â€ said Holmes. â€œWhen a
      crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I
      suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?â€

      â€œWould that suit Dr. Watson?â€

      â€œPerfectly.â€

      â€œThen on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet
      at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.â€

      We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph,
      and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown
      boot from under a cabinet.

      â€œMy missing boot!â€ he cried.

      â€œMay all our difficulties vanish as easily!â€ said Sherlock
      Holmes.

      â€œBut it is a very singular thing,â€ Dr. Mortimer remarked. â€œI
      searched this room carefully before lunch.â€

      â€œAnd so did I,â€ said Baskerville. â€œEvery inch of it.â€

      â€œThere was certainly no boot in it then.â€

      â€œIn that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
      lunching.â€

      The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the
      matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been
      added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small
      mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting
      aside the whole grim story of Sir Charlesâ€™s death, we had a line
      of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days,
      which included the receipt of the printed letter, the
      black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot,
      the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new
      brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to
      Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that
      his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some
      scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected
      episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening
      he sat lost in tobacco and thought.

      Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:

      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.

      The second:

      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry to report
      unable to trace cut sheet of _Times_. CARTWRIGHT.

      â€œThere go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more
      stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We
      must cast round for another scent.â€

      â€œWe have still the cabman who drove the spy.â€

      â€œExactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the
      Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an
      answer to my question.â€

      The ring at the bell proved to be something even more
      satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a
      rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.

      â€œI got a message from the head office that a gent at this address
      had been inquiring for No. 2704,â€ said he. â€œIâ€™ve driven my cab
      this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here
      straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had
      against me.â€

      â€œI have nothing in the world against you, my good man,â€ said
      Holmes. â€œOn the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you
      will give me a clear answer to my questions.â€

      â€œWell, Iâ€™ve had a good day and no mistake,â€ said the cabman with
      a grin. â€œWhat was it you wanted to ask, sir?â€

      â€œFirst of all your name and address, in case I want you again.â€

      â€œJohn Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of
      Shipleyâ€™s Yard, near Waterloo Station.â€

      Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.

      â€œNow, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched
      this house at ten oâ€™clock this morning and afterwards followed
      the two gentlemen down Regent Street.â€

      The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. â€œWhy, thereâ€™s
      no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I
      do already,â€ said he. â€œThe truth is that the gentleman told me
      that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him
      to anyone.â€

      â€œMy good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may
      find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide
      anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a
      detective?â€

      â€œYes, he did.â€

      â€œWhen did he say this?â€

      â€œWhen he left me.â€

      â€œDid he say anything more?â€

      â€œHe mentioned his name.â€

      Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. â€œOh, he mentioned
      his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he
      mentioned?â€

      â€œHis name,â€ said the cabman, â€œwas Mr. Sherlock Holmes.â€

      Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by
      the cabmanâ€™s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement.
      Then he burst into a hearty laugh.

      â€œA touch, Watsonâ€”an undeniable touch!â€ said he. â€œI feel a foil as
      quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily
      that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?â€

      â€œYes, sir, that was the gentlemanâ€™s name.â€

      â€œExcellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that
      occurred.â€

      â€œHe hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that
      he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do
      exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad
      enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel
      and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from
      the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near
      here.â€

      â€œThis very door,â€ said Holmes.

      â€œWell, I couldnâ€™t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew
      all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an
      hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and
      we followed down Baker Street and alongâ€”â€

      â€œI know,â€ said Holmes.

      â€œUntil we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my
      gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive
      right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped
      up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid
      up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the
      station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:
      â€˜It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes.â€™ Thatâ€™s how I come to know the name.â€

      â€œI see. And you saw no more of him?â€

      â€œNot after he went into the station.â€

      â€œAnd how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?â€

      The cabman scratched his head. â€œWell, he wasnâ€™t altogether such
      an easy gentleman to describe. Iâ€™d put him at forty years of age,
      and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than
      you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard,
      cut square at the end, and a pale face. I donâ€™t know as I could
      say more than that.â€

      â€œColour of his eyes?â€

      â€œNo, I canâ€™t say that.â€

      â€œNothing more that you can remember?â€

      â€œNo, sir; nothing.â€

      â€œWell, then, here is your half-sovereign. Thereâ€™s another one
      waiting for you if you can bring any more information.
      Good-night!â€

      â€œGood-night, sir, and thank you!â€

      John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a
      shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.

      â€œSnap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,â€ said he.
      â€œThe cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry
      Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,
      conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my
      hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I
      tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of
      our steel. Iâ€™ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you
      better luck in Devonshire. But Iâ€™m not easy in my mind about it.â€

      â€œAbout what?â€

      â€œAbout sending you. Itâ€™s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly
      dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it.
      Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I
      shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker
      Street once more.â€
