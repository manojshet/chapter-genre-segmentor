The Problem


      I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a
      thrill in the doctorâ€™s voice which showed that he was himself
      deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in
      his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot
      from them when he was keenly interested.

      â€œYou saw this?â€

      â€œAs clearly as I see you.â€

      â€œAnd you said nothing?â€

      â€œWhat was the use?â€

      â€œHow was it that no one else saw it?â€

      â€œThe marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave
      them a thought. I donâ€™t suppose I should have done so had I not
      known this legend.â€

      â€œThere are many sheep-dogs on the moor?â€

      â€œNo doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.â€

      â€œYou say it was large?â€

      â€œEnormous.â€

      â€œBut it had not approached the body?â€

      â€œNo.â€

      â€œWhat sort of night was it?â€™

      â€œDamp and raw.â€

      â€œBut not actually raining?â€

      â€œNo.â€

      â€œWhat is the alley like?â€

      â€œThere are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and
      impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.â€

      â€œIs there anything between the hedges and the walk?â€

      â€œYes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either
      side.â€

      â€œI understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a
      gate?â€

      â€œYes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.â€

      â€œIs there any other opening?â€

      â€œNone.â€

      â€œSo that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it
      from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?â€

      â€œThere is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.â€

      â€œHad Sir Charles reached this?â€

      â€œNo; he lay about fifty yards from it.â€

      â€œNow, tell me, Dr. Mortimerâ€”and this is importantâ€”the marks which
      you saw were on the path and not on the grass?â€

      â€œNo marks could show on the grass.â€

      â€œWere they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?â€

      â€œYes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the
      moor-gate.â€

      â€œYou interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate
      closed?â€

      â€œClosed and padlocked.â€

      â€œHow high was it?â€

      â€œAbout four feet high.â€

      â€œThen anyone could have got over it?â€

      â€œYes.â€

      â€œAnd what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?â€

      â€œNone in particular.â€

      â€œGood heaven! Did no one examine?â€

      â€œYes, I examined, myself.â€

      â€œAnd found nothing?â€

      â€œIt was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there
      for five or ten minutes.â€

      â€œHow do you know that?â€

      â€œBecause the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.â€

      â€œExcellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But
      the marks?â€

      â€œHe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I
      could discern no others.â€

      Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an
      impatient gesture.

      â€œIf I had only been there!â€ he cried. â€œIt is evidently a case of
      extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense
      opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon
      which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by
      the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.
      Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called
      me in! You have indeed much to answer for.â€

      â€œI could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these
      facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not
      wishing to do so. Besides, besidesâ€”â€

      â€œWhy do you hesitate?â€

      â€œThere is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of
      detectives is helpless.â€

      â€œYou mean that the thing is supernatural?â€

      â€œI did not positively say so.â€

      â€œNo, but you evidently think it.â€

      â€œSince the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears
      several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled
      order of Nature.â€

      â€œFor example?â€

      â€œI find that before the terrible event occurred several people
      had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this
      Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal
      known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,
      luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men,
      one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a
      moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful
      apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the
      legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the
      district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at
      night.â€

      â€œAnd you, a trained man of science, believe it to be
      supernatural?â€

      â€œI do not know what to believe.â€

      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. â€œI have hitherto confined my
      investigations to this world,â€ said he. â€œIn a modest way I have
      combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would,
      perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the
      footmark is material.â€

      â€œThe original hound was material enough to tug a manâ€™s throat
      out, and yet he was diabolical as well.â€

      â€œI see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
      now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why
      have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same
      breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charlesâ€™s death, and
      that you desire me to do it.â€

      â€œI did not say that I desired you to do it.â€

      â€œThen, how can I assist you?â€

      â€œBy advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry
      Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Stationâ€â€”Dr. Mortimer looked
      at his watchâ€”â€œin exactly one hour and a quarter.â€

      â€œHe being the heir?â€

      â€œYes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
      gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
      accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
      way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and
      executor of Sir Charlesâ€™s will.â€

      â€œThere is no other claimant, I presume?â€

      â€œNone. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
      Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor
      Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is
      the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black
      sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville
      strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family
      picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to
      Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is
      the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet
      him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at
      Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise
      me to do with him?â€

      â€œWhy should he not go to the home of his fathers?â€

      â€œIt seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
      Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure
      that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he
      would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old
      race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet
      it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak
      countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which
      has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is
      no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by
      my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring
      the case before you and ask for your advice.â€

      Holmes considered for a little time.

      â€œPut into plain words, the matter is this,â€ said he. â€œIn your
      opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an
      unsafe abode for a Baskervilleâ€”that is your opinion?â€

      â€œAt least I might go the length of saying that there is some
      evidence that this may be so.â€

      â€œExactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
      could work the young man evil in London as easily as in
      Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry
      would be too inconceivable a thing.â€

      â€œYou put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
      probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
      things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young
      man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
      minutes. What would you recommend?â€

      â€œI recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who
      is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet
      Sir Henry Baskerville.â€

      â€œAnd then?â€

      â€œAnd then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up
      my mind about the matter.â€

      â€œHow long will it take you to make up your mind?â€

      â€œTwenty-four hours. At ten oâ€™clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will
      be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will
      be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir
      Henry Baskerville with you.â€

      â€œI will do so, Mr. Holmes.â€ He scribbled the appointment on his
      shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
      fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

      â€œOnly one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
      Charles Baskervilleâ€™s death several people saw this apparition
      upon the moor?â€

      â€œThree people did.â€

      â€œDid any see it after?â€

      â€œI have not heard of any.â€

      â€œThank you. Good-morning.â€

      Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
      satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

      â€œGoing out, Watson?â€

      â€œUnless I can help you.â€

      â€œNo, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to
      you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points
      of view. When you pass Bradleyâ€™s, would you ask him to send up a
      pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as
      well if you could make it convenient not to return before
      evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to
      this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this
      morning.â€

      I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my
      friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during
      which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed
      alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up
      his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.
      I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker
      Street until evening. It was nearly nine oâ€™clock when I found
      myself in the sitting-room once more.

      My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had
      broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light
      of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,
      however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of
      strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me
      coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his
      dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe
      between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.

      â€œCaught cold, Watson?â€ said he.

      â€œNo, itâ€™s this poisonous atmosphere.â€

      â€œI suppose it _is_ pretty thick, now that you mention it.â€

      â€œThick! It is intolerable.â€

      â€œOpen the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
      perceive.â€

      â€œMy dear Holmes!â€

      â€œAm I right?â€

      â€œCertainly, but how?â€

      He laughed at my bewildered expression. â€œThere is a delightful
      freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to
      exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A
      gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
      immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
      boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man
      with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
      obvious?â€

      â€œWell, it is rather obvious.â€

      â€œThe world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance
      ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?â€

      â€œA fixture also.â€

      â€œOn the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.â€

      â€œIn spirit?â€

      â€œExactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret
      to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and
      an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
      Stamfordâ€™s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and
      my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I
      could find my way about.â€

      â€œA large-scale map, I presume?â€

      â€œVery large.â€

      He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. â€œHere you have
      the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville
      Hall in the middle.â€

      â€œWith a wood round it?â€

      â€œExactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that
      name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you
      perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings
      here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has
      his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you
      see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall,
      which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated
      here which may be the residence of the naturalistâ€”Stapleton, if I
      remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses,
      High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict
      prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points
      extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage
      upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to
      play it again.â€

      â€œIt must be a wild place.â€

      â€œYes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to
      have a hand in the affairs of menâ€”â€

      â€œThen you are yourself inclining to the supernatural
      explanation.â€

      â€œThe devilâ€™s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?
      There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is
      whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what
      is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.
      Mortimerâ€™s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with
      forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of
      our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other
      hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think weâ€™ll shut
      that window again, if you donâ€™t mind. It is a singular thing, but
      I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of
      thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box
      to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have
      you turned the case over in your mind?â€

      â€œYes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.â€

      â€œWhat do you make of it?â€

      â€œIt is very bewildering.â€

      â€œIt has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
      distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
      What do you make of that?â€

      â€œMortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that
      portion of the alley.â€

      â€œHe only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why
      should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?â€

      â€œWhat then?â€

      â€œHe was running, Watsonâ€”running desperately, running for his
      life, running until he burst his heartâ€”and fell dead upon his
      face.â€

      â€œRunning from what?â€

      â€œThere lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
      crazed with fear before ever he began to run.â€

      â€œHow can you say that?â€

      â€œI am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across
      the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man
      who had lost his wits would have run _from_ the house instead of
      towards it. If the gipsyâ€™s evidence may be taken as true, he ran
      with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely
      to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why
      was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own
      house?â€

      â€œYou think that he was waiting for someone?â€

      â€œThe man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
      evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement.
      Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as
      Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given
      him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?â€

      â€œBut he went out every evening.â€

      â€œI think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every
      evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the
      moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made
      his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It
      becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we
      will postpone all further thought upon this business until we
      have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry
      Baskerville in the morning.â€
