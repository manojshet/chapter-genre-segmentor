The Stapletons of Merripit House


      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface
      from our minds the grim and grey impression which had been left
      upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As
      Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through
      the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour
      from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling
      glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realise
      that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom
      into our souls upon the evening before.

      â€œI guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to
      blame!â€ said the baronet. â€œWe were tired with our journey and
      chilled by our drive, so we took a grey view of the place. Now we
      are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.â€

      â€œAnd yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,â€ I
      answered. â€œDid you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman
      I think, sobbing in the night?â€

      â€œThat is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I
      heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was
      no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.â€

      â€œI heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob
      of a woman.â€

      â€œWe must ask about this right away.â€ He rang the bell and asked
      Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed
      to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler
      still as he listened to his masterâ€™s question.

      â€œThere are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,â€ he answered.
      â€œOne is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The
      other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could
      not have come from her.â€

      And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after
      breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun
      full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured
      woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes
      were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,
      then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must
      know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in
      declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did
      she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,
      black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery
      and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the
      body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the
      circumstances which led up to the old manâ€™s death. Was it
      possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in
      the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the
      same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such
      an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I
      settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to
      see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had
      really been placed in Barrymoreâ€™s own hands. Be the answer what
      it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock
      Holmes.

      Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that
      the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk
      of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a
      small grey hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to
      be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the
      rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a
      clear recollection of the telegram.

      â€œCertainly, sir,â€ said he, â€œI had the telegram delivered to Mr.
      Barrymore exactly as directed.â€

      â€œWho delivered it?â€

      â€œMy boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore
      at the Hall last week, did you not?â€

      â€œYes, father, I delivered it.â€

      â€œInto his own hands?â€ I asked.

      â€œWell, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put
      it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymoreâ€™s hands,
      and she promised to deliver it at once.â€

      â€œDid you see Mr. Barrymore?â€

      â€œNo, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.â€

      â€œIf you didnâ€™t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?â€

      â€œWell, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,â€ said the
      postmaster testily. â€œDidnâ€™t he get the telegram? If there is any
      mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.â€

      It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was
      clear that in spite of Holmesâ€™s ruse we had no proof that
      Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it
      were soâ€”suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen
      Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he
      returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or had
      he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he have
      in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the strange
      warning clipped out of the leading article of the _Times_. Was
      that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was
      bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive
      was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the
      family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home
      would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an
      explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the
      deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible
      net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more
      complex case had come to him in all the long series of his
      sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the
      grey, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his
      preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of
      responsibility from my shoulders.

      Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running
      feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned,
      expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a
      stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven,
      prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and
      forty years of age, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a straw
      hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and
      he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.

      â€œYou will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,â€ said he
      as he came panting up to where I stood. â€œHere on the moor we are
      homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may
      possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I
      am Stapleton, of Merripit House.â€

      â€œYour net and box would have told me as much,â€ said I, â€œfor I
      knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know
      me?â€

      â€œI have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me
      from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the
      same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce
      myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his
      journey?â€

      â€œHe is very well, thank you.â€

      â€œWe were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir
      Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking
      much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of
      this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great
      deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no
      superstitious fears in the matter?â€

      â€œI do not think that it is likely.â€

      â€œOf course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the
      family?â€

      â€œI have heard it.â€

      â€œIt is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here!
      Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a
      creature upon the moor.â€ He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to
      read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. â€œThe
      story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and
      I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.â€

      â€œBut how?â€

      â€œHis nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog
      might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy
      that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night
      in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I
      was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was
      weak.â€

      â€œHow did you know that?â€

      â€œMy friend Mortimer told me.â€

      â€œYou think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he
      died of fright in consequence?â€

      â€œHave you any better explanation?â€

      â€œI have not come to any conclusion.â€

      â€œHas Mr. Sherlock Holmes?â€

      The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the
      placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no
      surprise was intended.

      â€œIt is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.
      Watson,â€ said he. â€œThe records of your detective have reached us
      here, and you could not celebrate him without being known
      yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your
      identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock
      Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally
      curious to know what view he may take.â€

      â€œI am afraid that I cannot answer that question.â€

      â€œMay I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?â€

      â€œHe cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage
      his attention.â€

      â€œWhat a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark
      to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible
      way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will
      command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your
      suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might
      perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.â€

      â€œI assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,
      Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.â€

      â€œExcellent!â€ said Stapleton. â€œYou are perfectly right to be wary
      and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an
      unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not
      mention the matter again.â€

      We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from
      the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,
      boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone
      days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned
      towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing
      in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a grey
      plume of smoke.

      â€œA moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit
      House,â€ said he. â€œPerhaps you will spare an hour that I may have
      the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.â€

      My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henryâ€™s side. But
      then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his
      study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help
      with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the
      neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapletonâ€™s invitation, and
      we turned together down the path.

      â€œIt is a wonderful place, the moor,â€ said he, looking round over
      the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged
      granite foaming up into fantastic surges. â€œYou never tire of the
      moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains.
      It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.â€

      â€œYou know it well, then?â€

      â€œI have only been here two years. The residents would call me a
      newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my
      tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I
      should think that there are few men who know it better than I
      do.â€

      â€œIs it hard to know?â€

      â€œVery hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north
      here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe
      anything remarkable about that?â€

      â€œIt would be a rare place for a gallop.â€

      â€œYou would naturally think so and the thought has cost several
      their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots
      scattered thickly over it?â€

      â€œYes, they seem more fertile than the rest.â€

      Stapleton laughed. â€œThat is the great Grimpen Mire,â€ said he. â€œA
      false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I
      saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I
      saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole,
      but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a
      danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful
      place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and
      return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable
      ponies!â€

      Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges.
      Then a long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful
      cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my
      companionâ€™s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.

      â€œItâ€™s gone!â€ said he. â€œThe mire has him. Two in two days, and
      many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the
      dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them
      in its clutches. Itâ€™s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.â€

      â€œAnd you say you can penetrate it?â€

      â€œYes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can
      take. I have found them out.â€

      â€œBut why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?â€

      â€œWell, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off
      on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them
      in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the
      butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.â€

      â€œI shall try my luck some day.â€

      He looked at me with a surprised face. â€œFor Godâ€™s sake put such
      an idea out of your mind,â€ said he. â€œYour blood would be upon my
      head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of
      your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex
      landmarks that I am able to do it.â€

      â€œHalloa!â€ I cried. â€œWhat is that?â€

      A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It
      filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it
      came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then
      sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.
      Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.

      â€œQueer place, the moor!â€ said he.

      â€œBut what is it?â€

      â€œThe peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for
      its prey. Iâ€™ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so
      loud.â€

      I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge
      swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing
      stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which
      croaked loudly from a tor behind us.

      â€œYou are an educated man. You donâ€™t believe such nonsense as
      that?â€ said I. â€œWhat do you think is the cause of so strange a
      sound?â€

      â€œBogs make queer noises sometimes. Itâ€™s the mud settling, or the
      water rising, or something.â€

      â€œNo, no, that was a living voice.â€

      â€œWell, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?â€

      â€œNo, I never did.â€

      â€œItâ€™s a very rare birdâ€”practically extinctâ€”in England now, but
      all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be
      surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last
      of the bitterns.â€

      â€œItâ€™s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my
      life.â€

      â€œYes, itâ€™s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the
      hillside yonder. What do you make of those?â€

      The whole steep slope was covered with grey circular rings of
      stone, a score of them at least.

      â€œWhat are they? Sheep-pens?â€

      â€œNo, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man
      lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived
      there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he
      left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even
      see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go
      inside.

      â€œBut it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?â€

      â€œNeolithic manâ€”no date.â€

      â€œWhat did he do?â€

      â€œHe grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for
      tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look
      at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes,
      you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.
      Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides.â€

      A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an
      instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed
      in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the
      great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant,
      bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the
      air. His grey clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made
      him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching
      his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary
      activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the
      treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning
      round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the
      direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of
      Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was
      quite close.

      I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had
      been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor,
      and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a
      beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a
      most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast
      between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted,
      with light hair and grey eyes, while she was darker than any
      brunette whom I have seen in Englandâ€”slim, elegant, and tall. She
      had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have
      seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the
      beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant
      dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely
      moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then
      she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was
      about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned
      all my thoughts into a new channel.

      â€œGo back!â€ she said. â€œGo straight back to London, instantly.â€

      I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at
      me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.

      â€œWhy should I go back?â€ I asked.

      â€œI cannot explain.â€ She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a
      curious lisp in her utterance. â€œBut for Godâ€™s sake do what I ask
      you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.â€

      â€œBut I have only just come.â€

      â€œMan, man!â€ she cried. â€œCan you not tell when a warning is for
      your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from
      this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word
      of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me
      among the mareâ€™s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the
      moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties
      of the place.â€

      Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing
      hard and flushed with his exertions.

      â€œHalloa, Beryl!â€ said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of
      his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

      â€œWell, Jack, you are very hot.â€

      â€œYes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom
      found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed
      him!â€ He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced
      incessantly from the girl to me.

      â€œYou have introduced yourselves, I can see.â€

      â€œYes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to
      see the true beauties of the moor.â€

      â€œWhy, who do you think this is?â€

      â€œI imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.â€

      â€œNo, no,â€ said I. â€œOnly a humble commoner, but his friend. My
      name is Dr. Watson.â€

      A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. â€œWe have
      been talking at cross purposes,â€ said she.

      â€œWhy, you had not very much time for talk,â€ her brother remarked
      with the same questioning eyes.

      â€œI talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being
      merely a visitor,â€ said she. â€œIt cannot much matter to him
      whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come
      on, will you not, and see Merripit House?â€

      A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the
      farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into
      repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded
      it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and
      nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and
      melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated
      old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside,
      however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in
      which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked
      from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor
      rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel
      at what could have brought this highly educated man and this
      beautiful woman to live in such a place.

      â€œQueer spot to choose, is it not?â€ said he as if in answer to my
      thought. â€œAnd yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we
      not, Beryl?â€

      â€œQuite happy,â€ said she, but there was no ring of conviction in
      her words.

      â€œI had a school,â€ said Stapleton. â€œIt was in the north country.
      The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and
      uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping
      to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with oneâ€™s own
      character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were
      against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three
      of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of
      my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were
      not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I
      could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes
      for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here,
      and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr.
      Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you
      surveyed the moor out of our window.â€

      â€œIt certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little
      dullâ€”less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.â€

      â€œNo, no, I am never dull,â€ said she quickly.

      â€œWe have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting
      neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line.
      Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him
      well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I
      should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the
      acquaintance of Sir Henry?â€

      â€œI am sure that he would be delighted.â€

      â€œThen perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may
      in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him
      until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you
      come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of
      Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the
      south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through
      them lunch will be almost ready.â€

      But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the
      moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which
      had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all
      these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of
      these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite
      and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such
      intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and
      deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for
      lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the
      grass-grown path by which we had come.

      It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for
      those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was
      astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side
      of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions
      and she held her hand to her side.

      â€œI have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,â€
      said she. â€œI had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,
      or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am
      about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir
      Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application
      whatever to you.â€

      â€œBut I canâ€™t forget them, Miss Stapleton,â€ said I. â€œI am Sir
      Henryâ€™s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.
      Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should
      return to London.â€

      â€œA womanâ€™s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will
      understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or
      do.â€

      â€œNo, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look
      in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton,
      for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows
      all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with
      little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with
      no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you
      meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.â€

      An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her
      face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

      â€œYou make too much of it, Dr. Watson,â€ said she. â€œMy brother and
      I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him
      very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our
      house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the
      family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there
      must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was
      distressed therefore when another member of the family came down
      to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger
      which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.

      â€œBut what is the danger?â€

      â€œYou know the story of the hound?â€

      â€œI do not believe in such nonsense.â€

      â€œBut I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him
      away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The
      world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of
      danger?â€

      â€œBecause it _is_ the place of danger. That is Sir Henryâ€™s nature.
      I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information
      than this it would be impossible to get him to move.â€

      â€œI cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything
      definite.â€

      â€œI would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant
      no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not
      wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to
      which he, or anyone else, could object.â€

      â€œMy brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he
      thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He
      would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which
      might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now
      and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and
      suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!â€ She turned and had
      disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while
      I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
      Baskerville Hall.
