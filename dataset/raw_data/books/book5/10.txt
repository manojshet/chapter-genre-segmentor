Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson


      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have
      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now,
      however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am
      compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my
      recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few
      extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which
      are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed,
      then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the
      convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

      _October_ 16_th_.â€”A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain.
      The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and
      then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver
      veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders
      gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is
      melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction
      after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a
      weight at my heart and a feeling of impending dangerâ€”ever present
      danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define
      it.

      And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long
      sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister
      influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the
      last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions
      of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from
      peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.
      Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the
      distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it
      should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral
      hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its
      howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in
      with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one
      quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade
      me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to
      the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere
      fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting
      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies,
      and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard
      this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some
      huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain
      everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did
      it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one
      saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation
      offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,
      apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in
      London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry
      against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been
      the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where
      is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London, or has he
      followed us down here? Could heâ€”could he be the stranger whom I
      saw upon the tor?

      It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet
      there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one
      whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the
      neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far
      thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have
      been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he
      could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,
      just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him
      off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might
      find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one
      purpose I must now devote all my energies.

      My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second
      and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as
      possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have
      been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say
      nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to
      attain my own end.

      We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore
      asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in
      his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more
      than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty
      good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a
      time the baronet opened his door and called for me. â€œBarrymore
      considers that he has a grievance,â€ he said. â€œHe thinks that it
      was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,
      of his own free will, had told us the secret.â€

      The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.

      â€œI may have spoken too warmly, sir,â€ said he, â€œand if I have, I
      am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much
      surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning
      and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has
      enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.â€

      â€œIf you had told us of your own free will it would have been a
      different thing,â€ said the baronet, â€œyou only told us, or rather
      your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could
      not help yourself.â€

      â€œI didnâ€™t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir
      Henryâ€”indeed I didnâ€™t.â€

      â€œThe man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered
      over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You
      only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr.
      Stapletonâ€™s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend
      it. Thereâ€™s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.â€

      â€œHeâ€™ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon
      that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I
      assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary
      arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to
      South America. For Godâ€™s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the
      police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the
      chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for
      him. You canâ€™t tell on him without getting my wife and me into
      trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.â€

      â€œWhat do you say, Watson?â€

      I shrugged my shoulders. â€œIf he were safely out of the country it
      would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.â€

      â€œBut how about the chance of his holding someone up before he
      goes?â€

      â€œHe would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with
      all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he
      was hiding.â€

      â€œThat is true,â€ said Sir Henry. â€œWell, Barrymoreâ€”â€

      â€œGod bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have
      killed my poor wife had he been taken again.â€

      â€œI guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after
      what we have heard I donâ€™t feel as if I could give the man up, so
      there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.â€

      With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he
      hesitated and then came back.

      â€œYouâ€™ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the
      best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and
      perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the
      inquest that I found it out. Iâ€™ve never breathed a word about it
      yet to mortal man. Itâ€™s about poor Sir Charlesâ€™s death.â€

      The baronet and I were both upon our feet. â€œDo you know how he
      died?â€

      â€œNo, sir, I donâ€™t know that.â€

      â€œWhat then?â€

      â€œI know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a
      woman.â€

      â€œTo meet a woman! He?â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œAnd the womanâ€™s name?â€

      â€œI canâ€™t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.
      Her initials were L. L.â€

      â€œHow do you know this, Barrymore?â€

      â€œWell, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had
      usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well
      known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was
      glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was
      only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was
      from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a womanâ€™s hand.â€

      â€œWell?â€

      â€œWell, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have
      done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was
      cleaning out Sir Charlesâ€™s studyâ€”it had never been touched since
      his deathâ€”and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back
      of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but
      one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the
      writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black
      ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the
      letter and it said: â€˜Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
      this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were
      signed the initials L. L.â€

      â€œHave you got that slip?â€

      â€œNo, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.â€

      â€œHad Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?â€

      â€œWell, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should
      not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.â€

      â€œAnd you have no idea who L. L. is?â€

      â€œNo, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our
      hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charlesâ€™s
      death.â€

      â€œI cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this
      important information.â€

      â€œWell, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to
      us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir
      Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for
      us. To rake this up couldnâ€™t help our poor master, and itâ€™s well
      to go carefully when thereâ€™s a lady in the case. Even the best of
      usâ€”â€

      â€œYou thought it might injure his reputation?â€

      â€œWell, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have
      been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you
      unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.â€

      â€œVery good, Barrymore; you can go.â€ When the butler had left us
      Sir Henry turned to me. â€œWell, Watson, what do you think of this
      new light?â€

      â€œIt seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.â€

      â€œSo I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up
      the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there
      is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you
      think we should do?â€

      â€œLet Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue
      for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not
      bring him down.â€

      I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morningâ€™s
      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been
      very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street
      were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I
      had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his
      blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this
      new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his
      interest. I wish that he were here.

      _October_ 17_th_.â€”All day today the rain poured down, rustling on
      the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out
      upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his
      crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I
      thought of that other oneâ€”the face in the cab, the figure against
      the moon. Was he also out in that delugedâ€”the unseen watcher, the
      man of darkness? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I
      walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the
      rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears.
      God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the
      firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon
      which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit
      I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls
      drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured
      clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down
      the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the
      left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville
      Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life
      which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay
      thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace
      of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights
      before.

      As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his
      dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying
      farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and
      hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see
      how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his
      dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much
      troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had
      wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such
      consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen
      Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.

      â€œBy the way, Mortimer,â€ said I as we jolted along the rough road,
      â€œI suppose there are few people living within driving distance of
      this whom you do not know?â€

      â€œHardly any, I think.â€

      â€œCan you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are
      L. L.?â€

      He thought for a few minutes.

      â€œNo,â€ said he. â€œThere are a few gipsies and labouring folk for
      whom I canâ€™t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no
      one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,â€ he added after
      a pause. â€œThere is Laura Lyonsâ€”her initials are L. L.â€”but she
      lives in Coombe Tracey.â€

      â€œWho is she?â€ I asked.

      â€œShe is Franklandâ€™s daughter.â€

      â€œWhat! Old Frankland the crank?â€

      â€œExactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching
      on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The
      fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side.
      Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she
      had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other
      reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the
      girl has had a pretty bad time.â€

      â€œHow does she live?â€

      â€œI fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be
      more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she
      may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the
      bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did
      something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did
      for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It
      was to set her up in a typewriting business.â€

      He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to
      satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is
      no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow
      morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see
      this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will
      have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of
      mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent,
      for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent
      I asked him casually to what type Franklandâ€™s skull belonged, and
      so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have
      not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.

      I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous
      and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just
      now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due
      time.

      Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played
      Ã©cartÃ© afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the
      library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.

      â€œWell,â€ said I, â€œhas this precious relation of yours departed, or
      is he still lurking out yonder?â€

      â€œI donâ€™t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has
      brought nothing but trouble here! Iâ€™ve not heard of him since I
      left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.â€

      â€œDid you see him then?â€

      â€œNo, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.â€

      â€œThen he was certainly there?â€

      â€œSo you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took
      it.â€

      I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at
      Barrymore.

      â€œYou know that there is another man then?â€

      â€œYes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.â€

      â€œHave you seen him?â€

      â€œNo, sir.â€

      â€œHow do you know of him then?â€

      â€œSelden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. Heâ€™s in hiding,
      too, but heâ€™s not a convict as far as I can make out. I donâ€™t
      like it, Dr. Watsonâ€”I tell you straight, sir, that I donâ€™t like
      it.â€ He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.

      â€œNow, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter
      but that of your master. I have come here with no object except
      to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you donâ€™t like.â€

      Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst
      or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.

      â€œItâ€™s all these goings-on, sir,â€ he cried at last, waving his
      hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.
      â€œThereâ€™s foul play somewhere, and thereâ€™s black villainy brewing,
      to that Iâ€™ll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry
      on his way back to London again!â€

      â€œBut what is it that alarms you?â€

      â€œLook at Sir Charlesâ€™s death! That was bad enough, for all that
      the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.
      Thereâ€™s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for
      it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and
      waiting! Whatâ€™s he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no
      good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall
      be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henryâ€™s new servants
      are ready to take over the Hall.â€

      â€œBut about this stranger,â€ said I. â€œCan you tell me anything
      about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or
      what he was doing?â€

      â€œHe saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing
      away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he
      found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he
      was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not
      make out.â€

      â€œAnd where did he say that he lived?â€

      â€œAmong the old houses on the hillsideâ€”the stone huts where the
      old folk used to live.â€

      â€œBut how about his food?â€

      â€œSelden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and
      brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what
      he wants.â€

      â€œVery good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other
      time.â€ When the butler had gone I walked over to the black
      window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds
      and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild
      night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor.
      What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in
      such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest purpose
      can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that hut upon
      the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has
      vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have
      passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart
      of the mystery.
