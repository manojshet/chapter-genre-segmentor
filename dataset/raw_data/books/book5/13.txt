Fixing the Nets


      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,
      for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would
      bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however,
      when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any
      explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his
      wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet
      as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should
      know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to
      Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated
      relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he
      was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her
      he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the
      child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has
      not one woman to mourn him.

      â€œIâ€™ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in
      the morning,â€ said the baronet. â€œI guess I should have some
      credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadnâ€™t sworn not to go
      about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a
      message from Stapleton asking me over there.â€

      â€œI have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,â€
      said Holmes drily. â€œBy the way, I donâ€™t suppose you appreciate
      that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?â€

      Sir Henry opened his eyes. â€œHow was that?â€

      â€œThis poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your
      servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the
      police.â€

      â€œThat is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I
      know.â€

      â€œThatâ€™s lucky for himâ€”in fact, itâ€™s lucky for all of you, since
      you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not
      sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to
      arrest the whole household. Watsonâ€™s reports are most
      incriminating documents.â€

      â€œBut how about the case?â€ asked the baronet. â€œHave you made
      anything out of the tangle? I donâ€™t know that Watson and I are
      much the wiser since we came down.â€

      â€œI think that I shall be in a position to make the situation
      rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly
      difficult and most complicated business. There are several points
      upon which we still want lightâ€”but it is coming all the same.â€

      â€œWeâ€™ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We
      heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all
      empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was
      out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that
      one and put him on a chain Iâ€™ll be ready to swear you are the
      greatest detective of all time.â€

      â€œI think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will
      give me your help.â€

      â€œWhatever you tell me to do I will do.â€

      â€œVery good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without
      always asking the reason.â€

      â€œJust as you like.â€

      â€œIf you will do this I think the chances are that our little
      problem will soon be solved. I have no doubtâ€”â€

      He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the
      air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so
      still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical
      statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.

      â€œWhat is it?â€ we both cried.

      I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some
      internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes
      shone with amused exultation.

      â€œExcuse the admiration of a connoisseur,â€ said he as he waved his
      hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite
      wall. â€œWatson wonâ€™t allow that I know anything of art but that is
      mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now,
      these are a really very fine series of portraits.â€

      â€œWell, Iâ€™m glad to hear you say so,â€ said Sir Henry, glancing
      with some surprise at my friend. â€œI donâ€™t pretend to know much
      about these things, and Iâ€™d be a better judge of a horse or a
      steer than of a picture. I didnâ€™t know that you found time for
      such things.â€

      â€œI know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. Thatâ€™s a
      Kneller, Iâ€™ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and
      the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are
      all family portraits, I presume?â€

      â€œEvery one.â€

      â€œDo you know the names?â€

      â€œBarrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my
      lessons fairly well.â€

      â€œWho is the gentleman with the telescope?â€

      â€œThat is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the
      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is
      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the
      House of Commons under Pitt.â€

      â€œAnd this Cavalier opposite to meâ€”the one with the black velvet
      and the lace?â€

      â€œAh, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all
      the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the
      Baskervilles. Weâ€™re not likely to forget him.â€

      I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.

      â€œDear me!â€ said Holmes, â€œhe seems a quiet, meek-mannered man
      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his
      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.â€

      â€œThereâ€™s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the
      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.â€

      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer
      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were
      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,
      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow
      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the
      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it
      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.

      â€œDo you see anything there?â€

      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the
      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed
      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,
      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly
      intolerant eye.

      â€œIs it like anyone you know?â€

      â€œThere is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.â€

      â€œJust a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!â€ He stood upon
      a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved
      his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.

      â€œGood heavens!â€ I cried in amazement.

      The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.

      â€œHa, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces
      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal
      investigator that he should see through a disguise.â€

      â€œBut this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.â€

      â€œYes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears
      to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is
      enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The
      fellow is a Baskervilleâ€”that is evident.â€

      â€œWith designs upon the succession.â€

      â€œExactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of
      our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him,
      and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering
      in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a
      cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!â€
      He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away
      from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has
      always boded ill to somebody.

      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier
      still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.

      â€œYes, we should have a full day today,â€ he remarked, and he
      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. â€œThe nets are all in
      place, and the drag is about to begin. Weâ€™ll know before the day
      is out whether we have caught our big, lean-jawed pike, or
      whether he has got through the meshes.â€

      â€œHave you been on the moor already?â€

      â€œI have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death
      of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be
      troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my
      faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the
      door of my hut, as a dog does at his masterâ€™s grave, if I had not
      set his mind at rest about my safety.â€

      â€œWhat is the next move?â€

      â€œTo see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!â€

      â€œGood-morning, Holmes,â€ said the baronet. â€œYou look like a
      general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.â€

      â€œThat is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.â€

      â€œAnd so do I.â€

      â€œVery good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our
      friends the Stapletons tonight.â€

      â€œI hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people,
      and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.â€

      â€œI fear that Watson and I must go to London.â€

      â€œTo London?â€

      â€œYes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present
      juncture.â€

      The baronetâ€™s face perceptibly lengthened.

      â€œI hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The
      Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is
      alone.â€

      â€œMy dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what
      I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been
      happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us
      to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will
      you remember to give them that message?â€

      â€œIf you insist upon it.â€

      â€œThere is no alternative, I assure you.â€

      I saw by the baronetâ€™s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by
      what he regarded as our desertion.

      â€œWhen do you desire to go?â€ he asked coldly.

      â€œImmediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey,
      but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come
      back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell
      him that you regret that you cannot come.â€

      â€œI have a good mind to go to London with you,â€ said the baronet.
      â€œWhy should I stay here alone?â€

      â€œBecause it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word
      that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.â€

      â€œAll right, then, Iâ€™ll stay.â€

      â€œOne more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send
      back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to
      walk home.â€

      â€œTo walk across the moor?â€

      â€œYes.â€

      â€œBut that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me
      not to do.â€

      â€œThis time you may do it with safety. If I had not every
      confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but
      it is essential that you should do it.â€

      â€œThen I will do it.â€

      â€œAnd as you value your life do not go across the moor in any
      direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit
      House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.â€

      â€œI will do just what you say.â€

      â€œVery good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast
      as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.â€

      I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that
      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit
      would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however,
      that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how
      we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to
      be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit
      obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple
      of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and
      had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was
      waiting upon the platform.

      â€œAny orders, sir?â€

      â€œYou will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you
      arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name,
      to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is
      to send it by registered post to Baker Street.â€

      â€œYes, sir.â€

      â€œAnd ask at the station office if there is a message for me.â€

      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It
      ran:

      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive
      five-forty. Lestrade.

      â€œThat is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the
      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,
      Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by
      calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.â€

      His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use
      the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were
      really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when
      we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if
      mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last
      suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets
      drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.

      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened
      his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably
      amazed her.

      â€œI am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of
      the late Sir Charles Baskerville,â€ said he. â€œMy friend here, Dr.
      Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also
      of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.â€

      â€œWhat have I withheld?â€ she asked defiantly.

      â€œYou have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate
      at ten oâ€™clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his
      death. You have withheld what the connection is between these
      events.â€

      â€œThere is no connection.â€

      â€œIn that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary
      one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a
      connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you,
      Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the
      evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his
      wife as well.â€

      The lady sprang from her chair.

      â€œHis wife!â€ she cried.

      â€œThe fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for
      his sister is really his wife.â€

      Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms
      of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with
      the pressure of her grip.

      â€œHis wife!â€ she said again. â€œHis wife! He is not a married man.â€

      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

      â€œProve it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do soâ€”!â€

      The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.

      â€œI have come prepared to do so,â€ said Holmes, drawing several
      papers from his pocket. â€œHere is a photograph of the couple taken
      in York four years ago. It is indorsed â€˜Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,â€™
      but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also,
      if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by
      trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time
      kept St. Oliverâ€™s private school. Read them and see if you can
      doubt the identity of these people.â€

      She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid
      face of a desperate woman.

      â€œMr. Holmes,â€ she said, â€œthis man had offered me marriage on
      condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied
      to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of
      truth has he ever told me. And whyâ€”why? I imagined that all was
      for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a
      tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never
      kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him from the
      consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and
      there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to
      you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of
      any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.â€

      â€œI entirely believe you, madam,â€ said Sherlock Holmes. â€œThe
      recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps
      it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can
      check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this
      letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?â€

      â€œHe dictated it.â€

      â€œI presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive
      help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your
      divorce?â€

      â€œExactly.â€

      â€œAnd then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from
      keeping the appointment?â€

      â€œHe told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other
      man should find the money for such an object, and that though he
      was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing
      the obstacles which divided us.â€

      â€œHe appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard
      nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?â€

      â€œNo.â€

      â€œAnd he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with
      Sir Charles?â€

      â€œHe did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and
      that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He
      frightened me into remaining silent.â€

      â€œQuite so. But you had your suspicions?â€

      She hesitated and looked down.

      â€œI knew him,â€ she said. â€œBut if he had kept faith with me I
      should always have done so with him.â€

      â€œI think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,â€ said
      Sherlock Holmes. â€œYou have had him in your power and he knew it,
      and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very
      near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning
      now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly
      hear from us again.â€

      â€œOur case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty
      thins away in front of us,â€ said Holmes as we stood waiting for
      the arrival of the express from town. â€œI shall soon be in the
      position of being able to put into a single connected narrative
      one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.
      Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in
      Godno, in Little Russia, in the year â€™66, and of course there are
      the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses
      some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no
      clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much
      surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this
      night.â€

      The London express came roaring into the station, and a small,
      wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We
      all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way
      in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a
      good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I
      could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner
      used then to excite in the practical man.

      â€œAnything good?â€ he asked.

      â€œThe biggest thing for years,â€ said Holmes. â€œWe have two hours
      before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in
      getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London
      fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night
      air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I donâ€™t suppose you
      will forget your first visit.â€
