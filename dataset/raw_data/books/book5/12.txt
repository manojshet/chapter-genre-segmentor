Death on the Moor


      For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my
      ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a
      crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be
      lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could
      belong to but one man in all the world.

      â€œHolmes!â€ I criedâ€”â€œHolmes!â€

      â€œCome out,â€ said he, â€œand please be careful with the revolver.â€

      I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone
      outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon
      my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and
      alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the
      wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other
      tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike
      love of personal cleanliness which was one of his
      characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen
      as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.

      â€œI never was more glad to see anyone in my life,â€ said I as I
      wrung him by the hand.

      â€œOr more astonished, eh?â€

      â€œWell, I must confess to it.â€

      â€œThe surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no
      idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that
      you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.â€

      â€œMy footprint, I presume?â€

      â€œNo, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your
      footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously
      desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I
      see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know
      that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it
      there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that
      supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.â€

      â€œExactly.â€

      â€œI thought as muchâ€”and knowing your admirable tenacity I was
      convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,
      waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I
      was the criminal?â€

      â€œI did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.â€

      â€œExcellent, Watson! And how did you localise me? You saw me,
      perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so
      imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?â€

      â€œYes, I saw you then.â€

      â€œAnd have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this
      one?â€

      â€œNo, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where
      to look.â€

      â€œThe old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make
      it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.â€ He
      rose and peeped into the hut. â€œHa, I see that Cartwright has
      brought up some supplies. Whatâ€™s this paper? So you have been to
      Coombe Tracey, have you?â€

      â€œYes.â€

      â€œTo see Mrs. Laura Lyons?â€

      â€œExactly.â€

      â€œWell done! Our researches have evidently been running on
      parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall
      have a fairly full knowledge of the case.â€

      â€œWell, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the
      responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my
      nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what
      have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street
      working out that case of blackmailing.â€

      â€œThat was what I wished you to think.â€

      â€œThen you use me, and yet do not trust me!â€ I cried with some
      bitterness. â€œI think that I have deserved better at your hands,
      Holmes.â€

      â€œMy dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in
      many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have
      seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your
      own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger
      which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter
      for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident
      that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my
      presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on
      their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could
      not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I
      remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all
      my weight at a critical moment.â€

      â€œBut why keep me in the dark?â€

      â€œFor you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have
      led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something,
      or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or
      other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought
      Cartwright down with meâ€”you remember the little chap at the
      express officeâ€”and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of
      bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given
      me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and
      both have been invaluable.â€

      â€œThen my reports have all been wasted!â€â€”My voice trembled as I
      recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.

      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.

      â€œHere are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I
      assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only
      delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly
      upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an
      extraordinarily difficult case.â€

      I was still rather raw over the deception which had been
      practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmesâ€™s praise drove my
      anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in
      what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I
      should not have known that he was upon the moor.

      â€œThatâ€™s better,â€ said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face.
      â€œAnd now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyonsâ€”it
      was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you
      had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in
      Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In
      fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I
      should have gone tomorrow.â€

      The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had
      turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There,
      sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my
      conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to
      repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.

      â€œThis is most important,â€ said he when I had concluded. â€œIt fills
      up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex
      affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists
      between this lady and the man Stapleton?â€

      â€œI did not know of a close intimacy.â€

      â€œThere can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write,
      there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a
      very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to
      detach his wifeâ€”â€

      â€œHis wife?â€

      â€œI am giving you some information now, in return for all that you
      have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is
      in reality his wife.â€

      â€œGood heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he
      have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?â€

      â€œSir Henryâ€™s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except
      Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make
      love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the
      lady is his wife and not his sister.â€

      â€œBut why this elaborate deception?â€

      â€œBecause he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to
      him in the character of a free woman.â€

      All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took
      shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive
      colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I
      seemed to see something terribleâ€”a creature of infinite patience
      and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.

      â€œIt is he, then, who is our enemyâ€”it is he who dogged us in
      London?â€

      â€œSo I read the riddle.â€

      â€œAnd the warningâ€”it must have come from her!â€

      â€œExactly.â€

      The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,
      loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.

      â€œBut are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman
      is his wife?â€

      â€œBecause he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
      autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare
      say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a
      schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more
      easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies
      by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession.
      A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief
      under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned
      itâ€”the name was differentâ€”had disappeared with his wife. The
      descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was
      devoted to entomology the identification was complete.â€

      The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the
      shadows.

      â€œIf this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons
      come in?â€ I asked.

      â€œThat is one of the points upon which your own researches have
      shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the
      situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce
      between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding
      Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming
      his wife.â€

      â€œAnd when she is undeceived?â€

      â€œWhy, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first
      duty to see herâ€”both of usâ€”tomorrow. Donâ€™t you think, Watson,
      that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should
      be at Baskerville Hall.â€

      The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had
      settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a
      violet sky.

      â€œOne last question, Holmes,â€ I said as I rose. â€œSurely there is
      no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it
      all? What is he after?â€

      Holmesâ€™s voice sank as he answered:

      â€œIt is murder, Watsonâ€”refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.
      Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even
      as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already
      almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten
      us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so.
      Another dayâ€”two at the mostâ€”and I have my case complete, but
      until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother
      watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified
      itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his
      side. Hark!â€

      A terrible screamâ€”a prolonged yell of horror and anguishâ€”burst
      out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the
      blood to ice in my veins.

      â€œOh, my God!â€ I gasped. â€œWhat is it? What does it mean?â€

      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic
      outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head
      thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.

      â€œHush!â€ he whispered. â€œHush!â€

      The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had
      pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it
      burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

      â€œWhere is it?â€ Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of
      his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.
      â€œWhere is it, Watson?â€

      â€œThere, I think.â€ I pointed into the darkness.

      â€œNo, there!â€

      Again the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and
      much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,
      muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling
      like the low, constant murmur of the sea.

      â€œThe hound!â€ cried Holmes. â€œCome, Watson, come! Great heavens, if
      we are too late!â€

      He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed
      at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground
      immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell,
      and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another
      sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.

      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.
      He stamped his feet upon the ground.

      â€œHe has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.â€

      â€œNo, no, surely not!â€

      â€œFool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes
      of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has
      happened weâ€™ll avenge him!â€

      Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,
      forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and
      rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those
      dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly
      round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing
      moved upon its dreary face.

      â€œCan you see anything?â€

      â€œNothing.â€

      â€œBut, hark, what is that?â€

      A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our
      left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which
      overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was
      spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it
      the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a
      prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled
      under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body
      hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So
      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant
      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a
      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which
      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again
      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he
      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool
      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it
      shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint
      within usâ€”the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!

      There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar
      ruddy tweed suitâ€”the very one which he had worn on the first
      morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one
      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,
      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and
      his face glimmered white through the darkness.

      â€œThe brute! The brute!â€ I cried with clenched hands. â€œOh Holmes,
      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.â€

      â€œI am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case
      well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my
      client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my
      career. But how could I knowâ€”how _could_ I knowâ€”that he would
      risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my
      warnings?â€

      â€œThat we should have heard his screamsâ€”my God, those screams!â€”and
      yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound
      which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks
      at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for
      this deed.â€

      â€œHe shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been
      murderedâ€”the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast
      which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end
      in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove
      the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we
      heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since
      Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens,
      cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another
      day is past!â€

      We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,
      overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had
      brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then
      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which
      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over
      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles
      off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light
      was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the
      Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.

      â€œWhy should we not seize him at once?â€

      â€œOur case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the
      last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we
      make one false move the villain may escape us yet.â€

      â€œWhat can we do?â€

      â€œThere will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only
      perform the last offices to our poor friend.â€

      Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and
      approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.
      The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain
      and blurred my eyes with tears.

      â€œWe must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way
      to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?â€

      He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing
      and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern,
      self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!

      â€œA beard! A beard! The man has a beard!â€

      â€œA beard?â€

      â€œIt is not the baronetâ€”it isâ€”why, it is my neighbour, the
      convict!â€

      With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that
      dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There
      could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal
      eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the
      light of the candle from over the rockâ€”the face of Selden, the
      criminal.

      Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the
      baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to
      Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in
      his escape. Boots, shirt, capâ€”it was all Sir Henryâ€™s. The tragedy
      was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death
      by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood,
      my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.

      â€œThen the clothes have been the poor devilâ€™s death,â€ said he. â€œIt
      is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article
      of Sir Henryâ€™sâ€”the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all
      probabilityâ€”and so ran this man down. There is one very singular
      thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that
      the hound was on his trail?â€

      â€œHe heard him.â€

      â€œTo hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like
      this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk
      recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have
      run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did
      he know?â€

      â€œA greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all
      our conjectures are correctâ€”â€

      â€œI presume nothing.â€

      â€œWell, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose
      that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would
      not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would
      be there.â€

      â€œMy difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think
      that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while
      mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what
      shall we do with this poor wretchâ€™s body? We cannot leave it here
      to the foxes and the ravens.â€

      â€œI suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can
      communicate with the police.â€

      â€œExactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.
      Halloa, Watson, whatâ€™s this? Itâ€™s the man himself, by all thatâ€™s
      wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicionsâ€”not a
      word, or my plans crumble to the ground.â€

      A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red
      glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish
      the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped
      when he saw us, and then came on again.

      â€œWhy, Dr. Watson, thatâ€™s not you, is it? You are the last man
      that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time
      of night. But, dear me, whatâ€™s this? Somebody hurt? Notâ€”donâ€™t
      tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!â€ He hurried past me and
      stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath
      and the cigar fell from his fingers.

      â€œWhoâ€”whoâ€™s this?â€ he stammered.

      â€œIt is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.â€

      Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort
      he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked
      sharply from Holmes to me. â€œDear me! What a very shocking affair!
      How did he die?â€

      â€œHe appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks.
      My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.â€

      â€œI heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy
      about Sir Henry.â€

      â€œWhy about Sir Henry in particular?â€ I could not help asking.

      â€œBecause I had suggested that he should come over. When he did
      not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his
      safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the wayâ€â€”his eyes
      darted again from my face to Holmesâ€™sâ€”â€œdid you hear anything else
      besides a cry?â€

      â€œNo,â€ said Holmes; â€œdid you?â€

      â€œNo.â€

      â€œWhat do you mean, then?â€

      â€œOh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom
      hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor.
      I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound
      tonight.â€

      â€œWe heard nothing of the kind,â€ said I.

      â€œAnd what is your theory of this poor fellowâ€™s death?â€

      â€œI have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off
      his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and
      eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.â€

      â€œThat seems the most reasonable theory,â€ said Stapleton, and he
      gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. â€œWhat do you
      think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?â€

      My friend bowed his compliments. â€œYou are quick at
      identification,â€ said he.

      â€œWe have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came
      down. You are in time to see a tragedy.â€

      â€œYes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friendâ€™s explanation will
      cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to
      London with me tomorrow.â€

      â€œOh, you return tomorrow?â€

      â€œThat is my intention.â€

      â€œI hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences
      which have puzzled us?â€

      Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

      â€œOne cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An
      investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not
      been a satisfactory case.â€

      My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner.
      Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.

      â€œI would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it
      would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified
      in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he
      will be safe until morning.â€

      And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapletonâ€™s offer of
      hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving
      the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure
      moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one
      black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was
      lying who had come so horribly to his end.

      â€œWeâ€™re at close grips at last,â€ said Holmes as we walked together
      across the moor. â€œWhat a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled
      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing
      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his
      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,
      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.â€

      â€œI am sorry that he has seen you.â€

      â€œAnd so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.â€

      â€œWhat effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he
      knows you are here?â€

      â€œIt may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to
      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be
      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has
      completely deceived us.â€

      â€œWhy should we not arrest him at once?â€

      â€œMy dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your
      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for
      argumentâ€™s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth
      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing
      against him. Thereâ€™s the devilish cunning of it! If he were
      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if
      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not
      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.â€

      â€œSurely we have a case.â€

      â€œNot a shadow of oneâ€”only surmise and conjecture. We should be
      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such
      evidence.â€

      â€œThere is Sir Charlesâ€™s death.â€

      â€œFound dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died
      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how
      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are
      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we
      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles
      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove
      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.â€

      â€œWell, then, tonight?â€

      â€œWe are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct
      connection between the hound and the manâ€™s death. We never saw
      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was
      running upon this manâ€™s trail. There is a complete absence of
      motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the
      fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our
      while to run any risk in order to establish one.â€

      â€œAnd how do you propose to do so?â€

      â€œI have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when
      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own
      plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I
      hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.â€

      I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in
      thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.

      â€œAre you coming up?â€

      â€œYes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,
      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that
      Seldenâ€™s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will
      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo
      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,
      to dine with these people.â€

      â€œAnd so am I.â€

      â€œThen you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be
      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think
      that we are both ready for our suppers.â€
