By and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all
sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three
boxes of seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of
our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good
time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the
ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said
he didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could
be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he
did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he
was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a
nigger.

I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and
how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each
other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead
of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:

â€œI didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain't hearn 'bout none un um,
skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a
pack er k'yards. How much do a king git?â€

â€œGet?â€ I says; â€œwhy, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to
them.â€

â€œ_Ain'_ dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?â€

â€œ_They_ don't do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.â€

â€œNo; is dat so?â€

â€œOf course it is. They just set around--except, maybe, when there's a
war; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or
go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?â€

We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a
steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.

â€œYes,â€ says I, â€œand other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the
parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.
But mostly they hang round the harem.â€

â€œRoun' de which?â€

â€œHarem.â€

â€œWhat's de harem?â€

â€œThe place where he keeps his wives. Don't you know about the harem?
Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.â€

â€œWhy, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it. A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I
reck'n. Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n
de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit dey say
Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. I doan' take no stock in
dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a
blim-blammin' all de time? No--'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud take
en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry
when he want to res'.â€

â€œWell, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told
me so, her own self.â€

â€œI doan k'yer what de widder say, he _warn't_ no wise man nuther. He
had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat
chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?â€

â€œYes, the widow told me all about it.â€

â€œ_Well_, den! Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? You jes'
take en look at it a minute. Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women;
heah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's
de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun'
mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to, en
han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat
had any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give
half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de way
Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you: what's
de use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a
half a chile? I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um.â€

â€œBut hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missed
it a thousand mile.â€

â€œWho? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints. I reck'n I
knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as
dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole
chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile
wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan'
talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.â€

â€œBut I tell you you don't get the point.â€

â€œBlame de point! I reck'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de _real_
pint is down furder--it's down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was
raised. You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man
gwyne to be waseful o' chillen? No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it. _He_
know how to value 'em. But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million
chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. _He_ as soon chop a
chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. A chile er two, mo' er less,
warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!â€

I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there
warn't no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of
any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let
Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off
in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that
would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say
he died there.

â€œPo' little chap.â€

â€œBut some says he got out and got away, and come to America.â€

â€œDat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, is
dey, Huck?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œDen he cain't git no situation. What he gwyne to do?â€

â€œWell, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them
learns people how to talk French.â€

â€œWhy, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?â€

â€œ_No_, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word.â€

â€œWell, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?â€

â€œI don't know; but it's so. I got some of their jabber out of a book.
S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you
think?â€

â€œI wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he
warn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.â€

â€œShucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's only saying, do you know
how to talk French?â€

â€œWell, den, why couldn't he _say_ it?â€

â€œWhy, he _is_ a-saying it. That's a Frenchman's _way_ of saying it.â€

â€œWell, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout
it. Dey ain' no sense in it.â€

â€œLooky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?â€

â€œNo, a cat don't.â€

â€œWell, does a cow?â€

â€œNo, a cow don't, nuther.â€

â€œDoes a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?â€

â€œNo, dey don't.â€

â€œIt's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't
it?â€

â€œCourse.â€

â€œAnd ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different
from _us_?â€

â€œWhy, mos' sholy it is.â€

â€œWell, then, why ain't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk
different from us? You answer me that.â€

â€œIs a cat a man, Huck?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œWell, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a
man?--er is a cow a cat?â€

â€œNo, she ain't either of them.â€

â€œWell, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the
yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman a man?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œ_Well_, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he _talk_ like a man? You answer
me _dat_!â€

I see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue.
So I quit.
