We stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says:

â€œLooky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I
know where Jim is.â€

â€œNo! Where?â€

â€œIn that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at
dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhat did you think the vittles was for?â€

â€œFor a dog.â€

â€œSo 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œBecause part of it was watermelon.â€

â€œSo it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and
don't see at the same time.â€

â€œWell, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table--same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,
and where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner. All
right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks
for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like
the best.â€

What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I
wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan,
but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:

â€œReady?â€

â€œYes,â€ I says.

â€œAll right--bring it out.â€

â€œMy plan is this,â€ I says.  â€œWe can easy find out if it's Jim in there.
Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river
on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and
Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?â€

â€œ_Work_? Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's
too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it. What's the good of a
plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk.
Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap
factory.â€

I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but
I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't
have none of them objections to it.

And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,
because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.

Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,
before everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all. It was
outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be
his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:

â€œDon't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what I'm
about?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œDidn't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œ_Well_, then.â€

That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any
more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I
couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have
it so, I couldn't help it.

When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard
so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make
no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by
in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and
the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the
north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just
one stout board nailed across it. I says:

â€œHere's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we
wrench off the board.â€

Tom says:

â€œIt's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky. I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more
complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ I says, â€œhow 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done
before I was murdered that time?â€

â€œThat's more _like_,â€ he says.  â€œIt's real mysterious, and troublesome,
and good,â€ he says; â€œbut I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.â€

Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that
joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long
as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at
the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and
searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;
so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,
and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,
and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection
with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but
some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;

â€œNow we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!â€

Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have
to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that
warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he
was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
time he made the trip.

In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it
_was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through
breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up
a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was
leaving, the key come from the house.

This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was
all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches
off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and
making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of
strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so
long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so
about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.
So Tom says:

â€œWhat's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?â€

The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:

â€œYes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at
'im?â€

â€œYes.â€

I hunched Tom, and whispers:

â€œYou going, right here in the daybreak? _that_ warn't the plan.â€

â€œNo, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.â€

So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in
we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure
enough, and could see us; and he sings out:

â€œWhy, _Huck_! En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?â€

I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know
nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger
busted in and says:

â€œWhy, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?â€

We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and
kind of wondering, and says:

â€œDoes _who_ know us?â€

â€œWhy, dis-yer runaway nigger.â€

â€œI don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?â€

â€œWhat _put_ it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed
you?â€

Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:

â€œWell, that's mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?
_what_ did he sing out?â€ And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,
â€œDid _you_ hear anybody sing out?â€

Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:

â€œNo; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.â€

Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,
and says:

â€œDid you sing out?â€

â€œNo, sah,â€ says Jim; â€œI hain't said nothing, sah.â€

â€œNot a word?â€

â€œNo, sah, I hain't said a word.â€

â€œDid you ever see us before?â€

â€œNo, sah; not as I knows on.â€

So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
says, kind of severe:

â€œWhat do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think
somebody sung out?â€

â€œOh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.
Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so.
Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole
me; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was
heah now--_den_ what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to
git aroun' it _dis_ time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's _sot_,
stays sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en
when _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.â€

Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and
says:

â€œI wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to
catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give
him up, I'd hang him.â€ And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to
look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim
and says:

â€œDon't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on
nights, it's us; we're going to set you free.â€

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted
us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
around then.
