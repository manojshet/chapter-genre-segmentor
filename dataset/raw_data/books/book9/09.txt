The Thirty-Nine Steps


â€œNonsense!â€ said the official from the Admiralty.

Sir Walter got up and left the room while we looked blankly at the
table. He came back in ten minutes with a long face. â€œI have spoken to
Alloa,â€ he said. â€œHad him out of bedâ€”very grumpy. He went straight home
after Mulrossâ€™s dinner.â€

â€œBut itâ€™s madness,â€ broke in General Winstanley. â€œDo you mean to tell
me that that man came here and sat beside me for the best part of half
an hour and that I didnâ€™t detect the imposture? Alloa must be out of
his mind.â€

â€œDonâ€™t you see the cleverness of it?â€ I said. â€œYou were too interested
in other things to have any eyes. You took Lord Alloa for granted. If
it had been anybody else you might have looked more closely, but it was
natural for him to be here, and that put you all to sleep.â€

Then the Frenchman spoke, very slowly and in good English.

â€œThe young man is right. His psychology is good. Our enemies have not
been foolish!â€

He bent his wise brows on the assembly.

â€œI will tell you a tale,â€ he said. â€œIt happened many years ago in
Senegal. I was quartered in a remote station, and to pass the time used
to go fishing for big barbel in the river. A little Arab mare used to
carry my luncheon basketâ€”one of the salted dun breed you got at
Timbuctoo in the old days. Well, one morning I had good sport, and the
mare was unaccountably restless. I could hear her whinnying and
squealing and stamping her feet, and I kept soothing her with my voice
while my mind was intent on fish. I could see her all the time, as I
thought, out of a corner of my eye, tethered to a tree twenty yards
away. After a couple of hours I began to think of food. I collected my
fish in a tarpaulin bag, and moved down the stream towards the mare,
trolling my line. When I got up to her I flung the tarpaulin on her
backâ€”â€

He paused and looked round.

â€œIt was the smell that gave me warning. I turned my head and found
myself looking at a lion three feet off.... An old man-eater, that was
the terror of the village.... What was left of the mare, a mass of
blood and bones and hide, was behind him.â€

â€œWhat happened?â€ I asked. I was enough of a hunter to know a true yarn
when I heard it.

â€œI stuffed my fishing-rod into his jaws, and I had a pistol. Also my
servants came presently with rifles. But he left his mark on me.â€ He
held up a hand which lacked three fingers.

â€œConsider,â€ he said. â€œThe mare had been dead more than an hour, and the
brute had been patiently watching me ever since. I never saw the kill,
for I was accustomed to the mareâ€™s fretting, and I never marked her
absence, for my consciousness of her was only of something tawny, and
the lion filled that part. If I could blunder thus, gentlemen, in a
land where menâ€™s senses are keen, why should we busy preoccupied urban
folk not err also?â€

Sir Walter nodded. No one was ready to gainsay him.

â€œBut I donâ€™t see,â€ went on Winstanley. â€œTheir object was to get these
dispositions without our knowing it. Now it only required one of us to
mention to Alloa our meeting tonight for the whole fraud to be
exposed.â€

Sir Walter laughed dryly. â€œThe selection of Alloa shows their acumen.
Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight? Or was he likely
to open the subject?â€

I remembered the First Sea Lordâ€™s reputation for taciturnity and
shortness of temper.

â€œThe one thing that puzzles me,â€ said the General, â€œis what good his
visit here would do that spy fellow? He could not carry away several
pages of figures and strange names in his head.â€

â€œThat is not difficult,â€ the Frenchman replied. â€œA good spy is trained
to have a photographic memory. Like your own Macaulay. You noticed he
said nothing, but went through these papers again and again. I think we
may assume that he has every detail stamped on his mind. When I was
younger I could do the same trick.â€

â€œWell, I suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans,â€ said
Sir Walter ruefully.

Whittaker was looking very glum. â€œDid you tell Lord Alloa what has
happened?â€ he asked. â€œNo? Well, I canâ€™t speak with absolute assurance,
but Iâ€™m nearly certain we canâ€™t make any serious change unless we alter
the geography of England.â€

â€œAnother thing must be said,â€ it was Royer who spoke. â€œI talked freely
when that man was here. I told something of the military plans of my
Government. I was permitted to say so much. But that information would
be worth many millions to our enemies. No, my friends, I see no other
way. The man who came here and his confederates must be taken, and
taken at once.â€

â€œGood God,â€ I cried, â€œand we have not a rag of a clue.â€

â€œBesides,â€ said Whittaker, â€œthere is the post. By this time the news
will be on its way.â€

â€œNo,â€ said the Frenchman. â€œYou do not understand the habits of the spy.
He receives personally his reward, and he delivers personally his
intelligence. We in France know something of the breed. There is still
a chance, _mes amis_. These men must cross the sea, and there are ships
to be searched and ports to be watched. Believe me, the need is
desperate for both France and Britain.â€

Royerâ€™s grave good sense seemed to pull us together. He was the man of
action among fumblers. But I saw no hope in any face, and I felt none.
Where among the fifty millions of these islands and within a dozen
hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest rogues in Europe?

Then suddenly I had an inspiration.

â€œWhere is Scudderâ€™s book?â€ I cried to Sir Walter. â€œQuick, man, I
remember something in it.â€

He unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me.

I found the place. â€œ_Thirty-nine steps_,â€ I read, and again,
â€œ_Thirty-nine stepsâ€”I counted themâ€”High tide_, 10.17 p.m.â€

The Admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought I had gone mad.

â€œDonâ€™t you see itâ€™s a clue,â€ I shouted. â€œScudder knew where these
fellows lairedâ€”he knew where they were going to leave the country,
though he kept the name to himself. Tomorrow was the day, and it was
some place where high tide was at 10.17.â€

â€œThey may have gone tonight,â€ someone said.

â€œNot they. They have their own snug secret way, and they wonâ€™t be
hurried. I know Germans, and they are mad about working to a plan.
Where the devil can I get a book of Tide Tables?â€

Whittaker brightened up. â€œItâ€™s a chance,â€ he said. â€œLetâ€™s go over to
the Admiralty.â€

We got into two of the waiting motor-carsâ€”all but Sir Walter, who went
off to Scotland Yardâ€”to â€œmobilize MacGillivrayâ€, so he said.

We marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers where the
charwomen were busy, till we reached a little room lined with books and
maps. A resident clerk was unearthed, who presently fetched from the
library the Admiralty Tide Tables. I sat at the desk and the others
stood round, for somehow or other I had got charge of this expedition.

It was no good. There were hundreds of entries, and so far as I could
see 10.17 might cover fifty places. We had to find some way of
narrowing the possibilities.

I took my head in my hands and thought. There must be some way of
reading this riddle. What did Scudder mean by steps? I thought of dock
steps, but if he had meant that I didnâ€™t think he would have mentioned
the number. It must be some place where there were several staircases,
and one marked out from the others by having thirty-nine steps.

Then I had a sudden thought, and hunted up all the steamer sailings.
There was no boat which left for the Continent at 10.17 p.m.

Why was high tide so important? If it was a harbour it must be some
little place where the tide mattered, or else it was a heavy-draught
boat. But there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour, and
somehow I didnâ€™t think they would travel by a big boat from a regular
harbour. So it must be some little harbour where the tide was
important, or perhaps no harbour at all.

But if it was a little port I couldnâ€™t see what the steps signified.
There were no sets of staircases on any harbour that I had ever seen.
It must be some place which a particular staircase identified, and
where the tide was full at 10.17. On the whole it seemed to me that the
place must be a bit of open coast. But the staircases kept puzzling me.

Then I went back to wider considerations. Whereabouts would a man be
likely to leave for Germany, a man in a hurry, who wanted a speedy and
a secret passage? Not from any of the big harbours. And not from the
Channel or the West Coast or Scotland, for, remember, he was starting
from London. I measured the distance on the map, and tried to put
myself in the enemyâ€™s shoes. I should try for Ostend or Antwerp or
Rotterdam, and I should sail from somewhere on the East Coast between
Cromer and Dover.

All this was very loose guessing, and I donâ€™t pretend it was ingenious
or scientific. I wasnâ€™t any kind of Sherlock Holmes. But I have always
fancied I had a kind of instinct about questions like this. I donâ€™t
know if I can explain myself, but I used to use my brains as far as
they went, and after they came to a blank wall I guessed, and I usually
found my guesses pretty right.

So I set out all my conclusions on a bit of Admiralty paper. They ran
like this:

FAIRLY CERTAIN.


(1) Place where there are several sets of stairs; one that matters
distinguished by having thirty-nine steps.
(2) Full tide at 10.17 p.m. Leaving shore only possible at full tide.
(3) Steps not dock steps, and so place probably not harbour.
(4) No regular night steamer at 10.17. Means of transport must be tramp
(unlikely), yacht, or fishing-boat.


There my reasoning stopped. I made another list, which I headed
â€œGuessedâ€, but I was just as sure of the one as the other.

GUESSED.


(1) Place not harbour but open coast.
(2) Boat smallâ€”trawler, yacht, or launch.
(3) Place somewhere on East Coast between Cromer and Dover.


It struck me as odd that I should be sitting at that desk with a
Cabinet Minister, a Field-Marshal, two high Government officials, and a
French General watching me, while from the scribble of a dead man I was
trying to drag a secret which meant life or death for us.

Sir Walter had joined us, and presently MacGillivray arrived. He had
sent out instructions to watch the ports and railway stations for the
three men whom I had described to Sir Walter. Not that he or anybody
else thought that that would do much good.

â€œHereâ€™s the most I can make of it,â€ I said. â€œWe have got to find a
place where there are several staircases down to the beach, one of
which has thirty-nine steps. I think itâ€™s a piece of open coast with
biggish cliffs, somewhere between the Wash and the Channel. Also itâ€™s a
place where full tide is at 10.17 tomorrow night.â€

Then an idea struck me. â€œIs there no Inspector of Coastguards or some
fellow like that who knows the East Coast?â€

Whittaker said there was, and that he lived in Clapham. He went off in
a car to fetch him, and the rest of us sat about the little room and
talked of anything that came into our heads. I lit a pipe and went over
the whole thing again till my brain grew weary.

About one in the morning the coastguard man arrived. He was a fine old
fellow, with the look of a naval officer, and was desperately
respectful to the company. I left the War Minister to cross-examine
him, for I felt he would think it cheek in me to talk.

â€œWe want you to tell us the places you know on the East Coast where
there are cliffs, and where several sets of steps run down to the
beach.â€

He thought for a bit. â€œWhat kind of steps do you mean, sir? There are
plenty of places with roads cut down through the cliffs, and most roads
have a step or two in them. Or do you mean regular staircasesâ€”all
steps, so to speak?â€

Sir Arthur looked towards me. â€œWe mean regular staircases,â€ I said.

He reflected a minute or two. â€œI donâ€™t know that I can think of any.
Wait a second. Thereâ€™s a place in Norfolkâ€”Brattleshamâ€”beside a
golf-course, where there are a couple of staircases, to let the
gentlemen get a lost ball.â€

â€œThatâ€™s not it,â€ I said.

â€œThen there are plenty of Marine Parades, if thatâ€™s what you mean.
Every seaside resort has them.â€

I shook my head. â€œItâ€™s got to be more retired than that,â€ I said.

â€œWell, gentlemen, I canâ€™t think of anywhere else. Of course, thereâ€™s
the Ruffâ€”â€

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ I asked.

â€œThe big chalk headland in Kent, close to Bradgate. Itâ€™s got a lot of
villas on the top, and some of the houses have staircases down to a
private beach. Itâ€™s a very high-toned sort of place, and the residents
there like to keep by themselves.â€

I tore open the Tide Tables and found Bradgate. High tide there was at
10.27 p.m. on the 15th of June.

â€œWeâ€™re on the scent at last,â€ I cried excitedly. â€œHow can I find out
what is the tide at the Ruff?â€

â€œI can tell you that, sir,â€ said the coastguard man. â€œI once was lent a
house there in this very month, and I used to go out at night to the
deep-sea fishing. The tideâ€™s ten minutes before Bradgate.â€

I closed the book and looked round at the company.

â€œIf one of those staircases has thirty-nine steps we have solved the
mystery, gentlemen,â€ I said. â€œI want the loan of your car, Sir Walter,
and a map of the roads. If Mr MacGillivray will spare me ten minutes, I
think we can prepare something for tomorrow.â€

It was ridiculous in me to take charge of the business like this, but
they didnâ€™t seem to mind, and after all I had been in the show from the
start. Besides, I was used to rough jobs, and these eminent gentlemen
were too clever not to see it. It was General Royer who gave me my
commission. â€œI for one,â€ he said, â€œam content to leave the matter in Mr
Hannayâ€™s hands.â€

By half-past three I was tearing past the moonlit hedgerows of Kent,
with MacGillivrayâ€™s best man on the seat beside me.
