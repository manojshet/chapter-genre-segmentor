The Coming of the Black Stone


I came down to breakfast next morning, after eight hours of blessed
dreamless sleep, to find Sir Walter decoding a telegram in the midst of
muffins and marmalade. His fresh rosiness of yesterday seemed a thought
tarnished.

â€œI had a busy hour on the telephone after you went to bed,â€ he said. â€œI
got my Chief to speak to the First Lord and the Secretary for War, and
they are bringing Royer over a day sooner. This wire clinches it. He
will be in London at five. Odd that the code word for a _Sous-chef
dâ€™Ã‰tat Major-General_ should be â€˜Porker.â€™â€

He directed me to the hot dishes and went on.

â€œNot that I think it will do much good. If your friends were clever
enough to find out the first arrangement they are clever enough to
discover the change. I would give my head to know where the leak is. We
believed there were only five men in England who knew about Royerâ€™s
visit, and you may be certain there were fewer in France, for they
manage these things better there.â€

While I ate he continued to talk, making me to my surprise a present of
his full confidence.

â€œCan the dispositions not be changed?â€ I asked.

â€œThey could,â€ he said. â€œBut we want to avoid that if possible. They are
the result of immense thought, and no alteration would be as good.
Besides, on one or two points change is simply impossible. Still,
something could be done, I suppose, if it were absolutely necessary.
But you see the difficulty, Hannay. Our enemies are not going to be
such fools as to pick Royerâ€™s pocket or any childish game like that.
They know that would mean a row and put us on our guard. Their aim is
to get the details without any one of us knowing, so that Royer will go
back to Paris in the belief that the whole business is still deadly
secret. If they canâ€™t do that they fail, for, once we suspect, they
know that the whole thing must be altered.â€

â€œThen we must stick by the Frenchmanâ€™s side till he is home again,â€ I
said. â€œIf they thought they could get the information in Paris they
would try there. It means that they have some deep scheme on foot in
London which they reckon is going to win out.â€

â€œRoyer dines with my Chief, and then comes to my house where four
people will see himâ€”Whittaker from the Admiralty, myself, Sir Arthur
Drew, and General Winstanley. The First Lord is ill, and has gone to
Sheringham. At my house he will get a certain document from Whittaker,
and after that he will be motored to Portsmouth where a destroyer will
take him to Havre. His journey is too important for the ordinary
boat-train. He will never be left unattended for a moment till he is
safe on French soil. The same with Whittaker till he meets Royer. That
is the best we can do, and itâ€™s hard to see how there can be any
miscarriage. But I donâ€™t mind admitting that Iâ€™m horribly nervous. This
murder of Karolides will play the deuce in the chancelleries of
Europe.â€

After breakfast he asked me if I could drive a car. â€œWell, youâ€™ll be my
chauffeur today and wear Hudsonâ€™s rig. Youâ€™re about his size. You have
a hand in this business and we are taking no risks. There are desperate
men against us, who will not respect the country retreat of an
overworked official.â€

When I first came to London I had bought a car and amused myself with
running about the south of England, so I knew something of the
geography. I took Sir Walter to town by the Bath Road and made good
going. It was a soft breathless June morning, with a promise of
sultriness later, but it was delicious enough swinging through the
little towns with their freshly watered streets, and past the summer
gardens of the Thames valley. I landed Sir Walter at his house in Queen
Anneâ€™s Gate punctually by half-past eleven. The butler was coming up by
train with the luggage.

The first thing he did was to take me round to Scotland Yard. There we
saw a prim gentleman, with a clean-shaven, lawyerâ€™s face.

â€œIâ€™ve brought you the Portland Place murderer,â€ was Sir Walterâ€™s
introduction.

The reply was a wry smile. â€œIt would have been a welcome present,
Bullivant. This, I presume, is Mr Richard Hannay, who for some days
greatly interested my department.â€

â€œMr Hannay will interest it again. He has much to tell you, but not
today. For certain grave reasons his tale must wait for four hours.
Then, I can promise you, you will be entertained and possibly edified.
I want you to assure Mr Hannay that he will suffer no further
inconvenience.â€

This assurance was promptly given. â€œYou can take up your life where you
left off,â€ I was told. â€œYour flat, which probably you no longer wish to
occupy, is waiting for you, and your man is still there. As you were
never publicly accused, we considered that there was no need of a
public exculpation. But on that, of course, you must please yourself.â€

â€œWe may want your assistance later on, MacGillivray,â€ Sir Walter said
as we left.

Then he turned me loose.

â€œCome and see me tomorrow, Hannay. I neednâ€™t tell you to keep deadly
quiet. If I were you I would go to bed, for you must have considerable
arrears of sleep to overtake. You had better lie low, for if one of
your Black Stone friends saw you there might be trouble.â€

I felt curiously at a loose end. At first it was very pleasant to be a
free man, able to go where I wanted without fearing anything. I had
only been a month under the ban of the law, and it was quite enough for
me. I went to the Savoy and ordered very carefully a very good
luncheon, and then smoked the best cigar the house could provide. But I
was still feeling nervous. When I saw anybody look at me in the lounge,
I grew shy, and wondered if they were thinking about the murder.

After that I took a taxi and drove miles away up into North London. I
walked back through fields and lines of villas and terraces and then
slums and mean streets, and it took me pretty nearly two hours. All the
while my restlessness was growing worse. I felt that great things,
tremendous things, were happening or about to happen, and I, who was
the cog-wheel of the whole business, was out of it. Royer would be
landing at Dover, Sir Walter would be making plans with the few people
in England who were in the secret, and somewhere in the darkness the
Black Stone would be working. I felt the sense of danger and impending
calamity, and I had the curious feeling, too, that I alone could avert
it, alone could grapple with it. But I was out of the game now. How
could it be otherwise? It was not likely that Cabinet Ministers and
Admiralty Lords and Generals would admit me to their councils.

I actually began to wish that I could run up against one of my three
enemies. That would lead to developments. I felt that I wanted
enormously to have a vulgar scrap with those gentry, where I could hit
out and flatten something. I was rapidly getting into a very bad
temper.

I didnâ€™t feel like going back to my flat. That had to be faced some
time, but as I still had sufficient money I thought I would put it off
till next morning, and go to a hotel for the night.

My irritation lasted through dinner, which I had at a restaurant in
Jermyn Street. I was no longer hungry, and let several courses pass
untasted. I drank the best part of a bottle of Burgundy, but it did
nothing to cheer me. An abominable restlessness had taken possession of
me. Here was I, a very ordinary fellow, with no particular brains, and
yet I was convinced that somehow I was needed to help this business
throughâ€”that without me it would all go to blazes. I told myself it was
sheer silly conceit, that four or five of the cleverest people living,
with all the might of the British Empire at their back, had the job in
hand. Yet I couldnâ€™t be convinced. It seemed as if a voice kept
speaking in my ear, telling me to be up and doing, or I would never
sleep again.

The upshot was that about half-past nine I made up my mind to go to
Queen Anneâ€™s Gate. Very likely I would not be admitted, but it would
ease my conscience to try.

I walked down Jermyn Street, and at the corner of Duke Street passed a
group of young men. They were in evening dress, had been dining
somewhere, and were going on to a music-hall. One of them was Mr
Marmaduke Jopley.

He saw me and stopped short.

â€œBy God, the murderer!â€ he cried. â€œHere, you fellows, hold him! Thatâ€™s
Hannay, the man who did the Portland Place murder!â€ He gripped me by
the arm, and the others crowded round. I wasnâ€™t looking for any
trouble, but my ill-temper made me play the fool. A policeman came up,
and I should have told him the truth, and, if he didnâ€™t believe it,
demanded to be taken to Scotland Yard, or for that matter to the
nearest police station. But a delay at that moment seemed to me
unendurable, and the sight of Marmieâ€™s imbecile face was more than I
could bear. I let out with my left, and had the satisfaction of seeing
him measure his length in the gutter.

Then began an unholy row. They were all on me at once, and the
policeman took me in the rear. I got in one or two good blows, for I
think, with fair play, I could have licked the lot of them, but the
policeman pinned me behind, and one of them got his fingers on my
throat.

Through a black cloud of rage I heard the officer of the law asking
what was the matter, and Marmie, between his broken teeth, declaring
that I was Hannay the murderer.

â€œOh, damn it all,â€ I cried, â€œmake the fellow shut up. I advise you to
leave me alone, constable. Scotland Yard knows all about me, and youâ€™ll
get a proper wigging if you interfere with me.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve got to come along of me, young man,â€ said the policeman. â€œI saw
you strike that gentleman crool â€™ard. You began it too, for he wasnâ€™t
doing nothing. I seen you. Best go quietly or Iâ€™ll have to fix you up.â€

Exasperation and an overwhelming sense that at no cost must I delay
gave me the strength of a bull elephant. I fairly wrenched the
constable off his feet, floored the man who was gripping my collar, and
set off at my best pace down Duke Street. I heard a whistle being
blown, and the rush of men behind me.

I have a very fair turn of speed, and that night I had wings. In a
jiffy I was in Pall Mall and had turned down towards St Jamesâ€™s Park. I
dodged the policeman at the Palace gates, dived through a press of
carriages at the entrance to the Mall, and was making for the bridge
before my pursuers had crossed the roadway. In the open ways of the
Park I put on a spurt. Happily there were few people about and no one
tried to stop me. I was staking all on getting to Queen Anneâ€™s Gate.

When I entered that quiet thoroughfare it seemed deserted. Sir Walterâ€™s
house was in the narrow part, and outside it three or four motor-cars
were drawn up. I slackened speed some yards off and walked briskly up
to the door. If the butler refused me admission, or if he even delayed
to open the door, I was done.

He didnâ€™t delay. I had scarcely rung before the door opened.

â€œI must see Sir Walter,â€ I panted. â€œMy business is desperately
important.â€

That butler was a great man. Without moving a muscle he held the door
open, and then shut it behind me. â€œSir Walter is engaged, sir, and I
have orders to admit no one. Perhaps you will wait.â€

The house was of the old-fashioned kind, with a wide hall and rooms on
both sides of it. At the far end was an alcove with a telephone and a
couple of chairs, and there the butler offered me a seat.

â€œSee here,â€ I whispered. â€œThereâ€™s trouble about and Iâ€™m in it. But Sir
Walter knows, and Iâ€™m working for him. If anyone comes and asks if I am
here, tell him a lie.â€

He nodded, and presently there was a noise of voices in the street, and
a furious ringing at the bell. I never admired a man more than that
butler. He opened the door, and with a face like a graven image waited
to be questioned. Then he gave them it. He told them whose house it
was, and what his orders were, and simply froze them off the doorstep.
I could see it all from my alcove, and it was better than any play.

I hadnâ€™t waited long till there came another ring at the bell. The
butler made no bones about admitting this new visitor.

While he was taking off his coat I saw who it was. You couldnâ€™t open a
newspaper or a magazine without seeing that faceâ€”the grey beard cut
like a spade, the firm fighting mouth, the blunt square nose, and the
keen blue eyes. I recognized the First Sea Lord, the man, they say,
that made the new British Navy.

He passed my alcove and was ushered into a room at the back of the
hall. As the door opened I could hear the sound of low voices. It shut,
and I was left alone again.

For twenty minutes I sat there, wondering what I was to do next. I was
still perfectly convinced that I was wanted, but when or how I had no
notion. I kept looking at my watch, and as the time crept on to
half-past ten I began to think that the conference must soon end. In a
quarter of an hour Royer should be speeding along the road to
Portsmouth....

Then I heard a bell ring, and the butler appeared. The door of the back
room opened, and the First Sea Lord came out. He walked past me, and in
passing he glanced in my direction, and for a second we looked each
other in the face.

Only for a second, but it was enough to make my heart jump. I had never
seen the great man before, and he had never seen me. But in that
fraction of time something sprang into his eyes, and that something was
recognition. You canâ€™t mistake it. It is a flicker, a spark of light, a
minute shade of difference which means one thing and one thing only. It
came involuntarily, for in a moment it died, and he passed on. In a
maze of wild fancies I heard the street door close behind him.

I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of his house.
We were connected at once, and I heard a servantâ€™s voice.

â€œIs his Lordship at home?â€ I asked.

â€œHis Lordship returned half an hour ago,â€ said the voice, â€œand has gone
to bed. He is not very well tonight. Will you leave a message, sir?â€

I rang off and almost tumbled into a chair. My part in this business
was not yet ended. It had been a close shave, but I had been in time.

Not a moment could be lost, so I marched boldly to the door of that
back room and entered without knocking.

Five surprised faces looked up from a round table. There was Sir
Walter, and Drew the War Minister, whom I knew from his photographs.
There was a slim elderly man, who was probably Whittaker, the Admiralty
official, and there was General Winstanley, conspicuous from the long
scar on his forehead. Lastly, there was a short stout man with an
iron-grey moustache and bushy eyebrows, who had been arrested in the
middle of a sentence.

Sir Walterâ€™s face showed surprise and annoyance.

â€œThis is Mr Hannay, of whom I have spoken to you,â€ he said
apologetically to the company. â€œIâ€™m afraid, Hannay, this visit is
ill-timed.â€

I was getting back my coolness. â€œThat remains to be seen, sir,â€ I said;
â€œbut I think it may be in the nick of time. For Godâ€™s sake, gentlemen,
tell me who went out a minute ago?â€

â€œLord Alloa,â€ Sir Walter said, reddening with anger.

â€œIt was not,â€ I cried; â€œit was his living image, but it was not Lord
Alloa. It was someone who recognized me, someone I have seen in the
last month. He had scarcely left the doorstep when I rang up Lord
Alloaâ€™s house and was told he had come in half an hour before and had
gone to bed.â€

â€œWhoâ€”whoâ€”â€ someone stammered.

â€œThe Black Stone,â€ I cried, and I sat down in the chair so recently
vacated and looked round at five badly scared gentlemen.
