The Man Who Died


I returned from the City about three oâ€™clock on that May afternoon
pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old
Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that
I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but
there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the
ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldnâ€™t get enough exercise, and
the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been
standing in the sun. â€œRichard Hannay,â€ I kept telling myself, â€œyou have
got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.â€

It made me bite my lips to think of the plans I had been building up
those last years in Buluwayo. I had got my pileâ€”not one of the big
ones, but good enough for me; and I had figured out all kinds of ways
of enjoying myself. My father had brought me out from Scotland at the
age of six, and I had never been home since; so England was a sort of
Arabian Nights to me, and I counted on stopping there for the rest of
my days.

But from the first I was disappointed with it. In about a week I was
tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of
restaurants and theatres and race-meetings. I had no real pal to go
about with, which probably explains things. Plenty of people invited me
to their houses, but they didnâ€™t seem much interested in me. They would
fling me a question or two about South Africa, and then get on to their
own affairs. A lot of Imperialist ladies asked me to tea to meet
schoolmasters from New Zealand and editors from Vancouver, and that was
the dismalest business of all. Here was I, thirty-seven years old,
sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning
my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back
to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.

That afternoon I had been worrying my brokers about investments to give
my mind something to work on, and on my way home I turned into my
clubâ€”rather a pot-house, which took in Colonial members. I had a long
drink, and read the evening papers. They were full of the row in the
Near East, and there was an article about Karolides, the Greek Premier.
I rather fancied the chap. From all accounts he seemed the one big man
in the show; and he played a straight game too, which was more than
could be said for most of them. I gathered that they hated him pretty
blackly in Berlin and Vienna, but that we were going to stick by him,
and one paper said that he was the only barrier between Europe and
Armageddon. I remember wondering if I could get a job in those parts.
It struck me that Albania was the sort of place that might keep a man
from yawning.

About six oâ€™clock I went home, dressed, dined at the CafÃ© Royal, and
turned into a music-hall. It was a silly show, all capering women and
monkey-faced men, and I did not stay long. The night was fine and clear
as I walked back to the flat I had hired near Portland Place. The crowd
surged past me on the pavements, busy and chattering, and I envied the
people for having something to do. These shop-girls and clerks and
dandies and policemen had some interest in life that kept them going. I
gave half-a-crown to a beggar because I saw him yawn; he was a
fellow-sufferer. At Oxford Circus I looked up into the spring sky and I
made a vow. I would give the Old Country another day to fit me into
something; if nothing happened, I would take the next boat for the
Cape.

My flat was the first floor in a new block behind Langham Place. There
was a common staircase, with a porter and a liftman at the entrance,
but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and each flat was
quite shut off from the others. I hate servants on the premises, so I
had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day. He arrived before
eight oâ€™clock every morning and used to depart at seven, for I never
dined at home.

I was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my
elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me
start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, gimlety
blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat on the top floor,
with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.

â€œCan I speak to you?â€ he said. â€œMay I come in for a minute?â€ He was
steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.

I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the
threshold than he made a dash for my back room, where I used to smoke
and write my letters. Then he bolted back.

â€œIs the door locked?â€ he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain
with his own hand.

â€œIâ€™m very sorry,â€ he said humbly. â€œItâ€™s a mighty liberty, but you
looked the kind of man who would understand. Iâ€™ve had you in my mind
all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good
turn?â€

â€œIâ€™ll listen to you,â€ I said. â€œThatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll promise.â€ I was getting
worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.

There was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he filled
himself a stiff whisky-and-soda. He drank it off in three gulps, and
cracked the glass as he set it down.

â€œPardon,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™m a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at
this moment to be dead.â€

I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.

â€œWhat does it feel like?â€ I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to
deal with a madman.

A smile flickered over his drawn face. â€œIâ€™m not madâ€”yet. Say, sir, Iâ€™ve
been watching you, and I reckon youâ€™re a cool customer. I reckon, too,
youâ€™re an honest man, and not afraid of playing a bold hand. Iâ€™m going
to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I
want to know if I can count you in.â€

â€œGet on with your yarn,â€ I said, â€œand Iâ€™ll tell you.â€

He seemed to brace himself for a great effort, and then started on the
queerest rigmarole. I didnâ€™t get hold of it at first, and I had to stop
and ask him questions. But here is the gist of it:

He was an American, from Kentucky, and after college, being pretty well
off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and acted as
war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in
South-Eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had
got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly
of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.

He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the
interest of them, and then because he couldnâ€™t help himself. I read him
as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots
of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

I am giving you what he told me as well as I could make it out. Away
behind all the Governments and the armies there was a big subterranean
movement going on, engineered by very dangerous people. He had come on
it by accident; it fascinated him; he went further, and then he got
caught. I gathered that most of the people in it were the sort of
educated anarchists that make revolutions, but that beside them there
were financiers who were playing for money. A clever man can make big
profits on a falling market, and it suited the book of both classes to
set Europe by the ears.

He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had puzzled
meâ€”things that happened in the Balkan War, how one state suddenly came
out on top, why alliances were made and broken, why certain men
disappeared, and where the sinews of war came from. The aim of the
whole conspiracy was to get Russia and Germany at loggerheads.

When I asked why, he said that the anarchist lot thought it would give
them their chance. Everything would be in the melting-pot, and they
looked to see a new world emerge. The capitalists would rake in the
shekels, and make fortunes by buying up wreckage. Capital, he said, had
no conscience and no fatherland. Besides, the Jew was behind it, and
the Jew hated Russia worse than hell.

â€œDo you wonder?â€ he cried. â€œFor three hundred years they have been
persecuted, and this is the return match for the _pogroms_. The Jew is
everywhere, but you have to go far down the backstairs to find him.
Take any big Teutonic business concern. If you have dealings with it
the first man you meet is Prince _von und zu_ Something, an elegant
young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English. But he cuts no ice. If
your business is big, you get behind him and find a prognathous
Westphalian with a retreating brow and the manners of a hog. He is the
German business man that gives your English papers the shakes. But if
youâ€™re on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real
boss, ten to one you are brought up against a little white-faced Jew in
a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, sir, he is the man
who is ruling the world just now, and he has his knife in the Empire of
the Tsar, because his aunt was outraged and his father flogged in some
one-horse location on the Volga.â€

I could not help saying that his Jew-anarchists seemed to have got left
behind a little.

â€œYes and no,â€ he said. â€œThey won up to a point, but they struck a
bigger thing than money, a thing that couldnâ€™t be bought, the old
elemental fighting instincts of man. If youâ€™re going to be killed you
invent some kind of flag and country to fight for, and if you survive
you get to love the thing. Those foolish devils of soldiers have found
something they care for, and that has upset the pretty plan laid in
Berlin and Vienna. But my friends havenâ€™t played their last card by a
long sight. Theyâ€™ve gotten the ace up their sleeves, and unless I can
keep alive for a month they are going to play it and win.â€

â€œBut I thought you were dead,â€ I put in.

â€œ_Mors janua vitÃ¦_,â€ he smiled. (I recognized the quotation: it was
about all the Latin I knew.) â€œIâ€™m coming to that, but Iâ€™ve got to put
you wise about a lot of things first. If you read your newspaper, I
guess you know the name of Constantine Karolides?â€

I sat up at that, for I had been reading about him that very afternoon.

â€œHe is the man that has wrecked all their games. He is the one big
brain in the whole show, and he happens also to be an honest man.
Therefore he has been marked down these twelve months past. I found
that outâ€”not that it was difficult, for any fool could guess as much.
But I found out the way they were going to get him, and that knowledge
was deadly. Thatâ€™s why I have had to decease.â€

He had another drink, and I mixed it for him myself, for I was getting
interested in the beggar.

â€œThey canâ€™t get him in his own land, for he has a bodyguard of Epirotes
that would skin their grandmothers. But on the 15th day of June he is
coming to this city. The British Foreign Office has taken to having
international tea-parties, and the biggest of them is due on that date.
Now Karolides is reckoned the principal guest, and if my friends have
their way he will never return to his admiring countrymen.â€

â€œThatâ€™s simple enough, anyhow,â€ I said. â€œYou can warn him and keep him
at home.â€

â€œAnd play their game?â€ he asked sharply. â€œIf he does not come they win,
for heâ€™s the only man that can straighten out the tangle. And if his
Government are warned he wonâ€™t come, for he does not know how big the
stakes will be on June the 15th.â€

â€œWhat about the British Government?â€ I said. â€œTheyâ€™re not going to let
their guests be murdered. Tip them the wink, and theyâ€™ll take extra
precautions.â€

â€œNo good. They might stuff your city with plain-clothes detectives and
double the police and Constantine would still be a doomed man. My
friends are not playing this game for candy. They want a big occasion
for the taking off, with the eyes of all Europe on it. Heâ€™ll be
murdered by an Austrian, and thereâ€™ll be plenty of evidence to show the
connivance of the big folk in Vienna and Berlin. It will all be an
infernal lie, of course, but the case will look black enough to the
world. Iâ€™m not talking hot air, my friend. I happen to know every
detail of the hellish contrivance, and I can tell you it will be the
most finished piece of blackguardism since the Borgias. But itâ€™s not
going to come off if thereâ€™s a certain man who knows the wheels of the
business alive right here in London on the 15th day of June. And that
man is going to be your servant, Franklin P. Scudder.â€

I was getting to like the little chap. His jaw had shut like a
rat-trap, and there was the fire of battle in his gimlety eyes. If he
was spinning me a yarn he could act up to it.

â€œWhere did you find out this story?â€ I asked.

â€œI got the first hint in an inn on the Achensee in Tyrol. That set me
inquiring, and I collected my other clues in a fur-shop in the Galician
quarter of Buda, in a Strangersâ€™ Club in Vienna, and in a little
bookshop off the Racknitzstrasse in Leipsig. I completed my evidence
ten days ago in Paris. I canâ€™t tell you the details now, for itâ€™s
something of a history. When I was quite sure in my own mind I judged
it my business to disappear, and I reached this city by a mighty queer
circuit. I left Paris a dandified young French-American, and I sailed
from Hamburg a Jew diamond merchant. In Norway I was an English student
of Ibsen collecting materials for lectures, but when I left Bergen I
was a cinema-man with special ski films. And I came here from Leith
with a lot of pulp-wood propositions in my pocket to put before the
London newspapers. Till yesterday I thought I had muddied my trail
some, and was feeling pretty happy. Then....â€

The recollection seemed to upset him, and he gulped down some more
whisky.

â€œThen I saw a man standing in the street outside this block. I used to
stay close in my room all day, and only slip out after dark for an hour
or two. I watched him for a bit from my window, and I thought I
recognized him.... He came in and spoke to the porter.... When I came
back from my walk last night I found a card in my letter-box. It bore
the name of the man I want least to meet on Godâ€™s earth.â€

I think that the look in my companionâ€™s eyes, the sheer naked scare on
his face, completed my conviction of his honesty. My own voice
sharpened a bit as I asked him what he did next.

â€œI realized that I was bottled as sure as a pickled herring, and that
there was only one way out. I had to die. If my pursuers knew I was
dead they would go to sleep again.â€

â€œHow did you manage it?â€

â€œI told the man that valets me that I was feeling pretty bad, and I got
myself up to look like death. That wasnâ€™t difficult, for Iâ€™m no slouch
at disguises. Then I got a corpseâ€”you can always get a body in London
if you know where to go for it. I fetched it back in a trunk on the top
of a four-wheeler, and I had to be assisted upstairs to my room. You
see I had to pile up some evidence for the inquest. I went to bed and
got my man to mix me a sleeping-draught, and then told him to clear
out. He wanted to fetch a doctor, but I swore some and said I couldnâ€™t
abide leeches. When I was left alone I started in to fake up that
corpse. He was my size, and I judged had perished from too much
alcohol, so I put some spirits handy about the place. The jaw was the
weak point in the likeness, so I blew it away with a revolver. I
daresay there will be somebody tomorrow to swear to having heard a
shot, but there are no neighbours on my floor, and I guessed I could
risk it. So I left the body in bed dressed up in my pyjamas, with a
revolver lying on the bed-clothes and a considerable mess around. Then
I got into a suit of clothes I had kept waiting for emergencies. I
didnâ€™t dare to shave for fear of leaving tracks, and besides, it wasnâ€™t
any kind of use my trying to get into the streets. I had had you in my
mind all day, and there seemed nothing to do but to make an appeal to
you. I watched from my window till I saw you come home, and then
slipped down the stair to meet you.... There, sir, I guess you know
about as much as me of this business.â€

He sat blinking like an owl, fluttering with nerves and yet desperately
determined. By this time I was pretty well convinced that he was going
straight with me. It was the wildest sort of narrative, but I had heard
in my time many steep tales which had turned out to be true, and I had
made a practice of judging the man rather than the story. If he had
wanted to get a location in my flat, and then cut my throat, he would
have pitched a milder yarn.

â€œHand me your key,â€ I said, â€œand Iâ€™ll take a look at the corpse. Excuse
my caution, but Iâ€™m bound to verify a bit if I can.â€

He shook his head mournfully. â€œI reckoned youâ€™d ask for that, but I
havenâ€™t got it. Itâ€™s on my chain on the dressing-table. I had to leave
it behind, for I couldnâ€™t leave any clues to breed suspicions. The
gentry who are after me are pretty bright-eyed citizens. Youâ€™ll have to
take me on trust for the night, and tomorrow youâ€™ll get proof of the
corpse business right enough.â€

I thought for an instant or two. â€œRight. Iâ€™ll trust you for the night.
Iâ€™ll lock you into this room and keep the key. Just one word, Mr
Scudder. I believe youâ€™re straight, but if so be you are not I should
warn you that Iâ€™m a handy man with a gun.â€

â€œSure,â€ he said, jumping up with some briskness. â€œI havenâ€™t the
privilege of your name, sir, but let me tell you that youâ€™re a white
man. Iâ€™ll thank you to lend me a razor.â€

I took him into my bedroom and turned him loose. In half an hourâ€™s time
a figure came out that I scarcely recognized. Only his gimlety, hungry
eyes were the same. He was shaved clean, his hair was parted in the
middle, and he had cut his eyebrows. Further, he carried himself as if
he had been drilled, and was the very model, even to the brown
complexion, of some British officer who had had a long spell in India.
He had a monocle, too, which he stuck in his eye, and every trace of
the American had gone out of his speech.

â€œMy hat! Mr Scudderâ€”â€ I stammered.

â€œNot Mr Scudder,â€ he corrected; â€œCaptain Theophilus Digby, of the 40th
Gurkhas, presently home on leave. Iâ€™ll thank you to remember that,
sir.â€

I made him up a bed in my smoking-room and sought my own couch, more
cheerful than I had been for the past month. Things did happen
occasionally, even in this God-forgotten metropolis.

I woke next morning to hear my man, Paddock, making the deuce of a row
at the smoking-room door. Paddock was a fellow I had done a good turn
to out on the Selakwe, and I had inspanned him as my servant as soon as
I got to England. He had about as much gift of the gab as a
hippopotamus, and was not a great hand at valeting, but I knew I could
count on his loyalty.

â€œStop that row, Paddock,â€ I said. â€œThereâ€™s a friend of mine,
Captainâ€”Captainâ€ (I couldnâ€™t remember the name) â€œdossing down in there.
Get breakfast for two and then come and speak to me.â€

I told Paddock a fine story about how my friend was a great swell, with
his nerves pretty bad from overwork, who wanted absolute rest and
stillness. Nobody had got to know he was here, or he would be besieged
by communications from the India Office and the Prime Minister and his
cure would be ruined. I am bound to say Scudder played up splendidly
when he came to breakfast. He fixed Paddock with his eyeglass, just
like a British officer, asked him about the Boer War, and slung out at
me a lot of stuff about imaginary pals. Paddock couldnâ€™t learn to call
me â€œsirâ€™, but he â€œsirredâ€™ Scudder as if his life depended on it.

I left him with the newspaper and a box of cigars, and went down to the
City till luncheon. When I got back the liftman had an important face.

â€œNawsty business â€™ere this morning, sir. Gent in No. 15 been and shot
â€™isself. Theyâ€™ve just took â€™im to the mortiary. The police are up there
now.â€

I ascended to No. 15, and found a couple of bobbies and an inspector
busy making an examination. I asked a few idiotic questions, and they
soon kicked me out. Then I found the man that had valeted Scudder, and
pumped him, but I could see he suspected nothing. He was a whining
fellow with a churchyard face, and half-a-crown went far to console
him.

I attended the inquest next day. A partner of some publishing firm gave
evidence that the deceased had brought him wood-pulp propositions, and
had been, he believed, an agent of an American business. The jury found
it a case of suicide while of unsound mind, and the few effects were
handed over to the American Consul to deal with. I gave Scudder a full
account of the affair, and it interested him greatly. He said he wished
he could have attended the inquest, for he reckoned it would be about
as spicy as to read oneâ€™s own obituary notice.

The first two days he stayed with me in that back room he was very
peaceful. He read and smoked a bit, and made a heap of jottings in a
note-book, and every night we had a game of chess, at which he beat me
hollow. I think he was nursing his nerves back to health, for he had
had a pretty trying time. But on the third day I could see he was
beginning to get restless. He fixed up a list of the days till June
15th, and ticked each off with a red pencil, making remarks in
shorthand against them. I would find him sunk in a brown study, with
his sharp eyes abstracted, and after those spells of meditation he was
apt to be very despondent.

Then I could see that he began to get edgy again. He listened for
little noises, and was always asking me if Paddock could be trusted.
Once or twice he got very peevish, and apologized for it. I didnâ€™t
blame him. I made every allowance, for he had taken on a fairly stiff
job.

It was not the safety of his own skin that troubled him, but the
success of the scheme he had planned. That little man was clean grit
all through, without a soft spot in him. One night he was very solemn.

â€œSay, Hannay,â€ he said, â€œI judge I should let you a bit deeper into
this business. I should hate to go out without leaving somebody else to
put up a fight.â€ And he began to tell me in detail what I had only
heard from him vaguely.

I did not give him very close attention. The fact is, I was more
interested in his own adventures than in his high politics. I reckoned
that Karolides and his affairs were not my business, leaving all that
to him. So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory. I
remember that he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not
begin till he had got to London, and would come from the very highest
quarters, where there would be no thought of suspicion. He mentioned
the name of a womanâ€”Julia Czechenyiâ€”as having something to do with the
danger. She would be the decoy, I gathered, to get Karolides out of the
care of his guards. He talked, too, about a Black Stone and a man that
lisped in his speech, and he described very particularly somebody that
he never referred to without a shudderâ€”an old man with a young voice
who could hood his eyes like a hawk.

He spoke a good deal about death, too. He was mortally anxious about
winning through with his job, but he didnâ€™t care a rush for his life.

â€œI reckon itâ€™s like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired out,
and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming in at the
window. I used to thank God for such mornings way back in the
Blue-Grass country, and I guess Iâ€™ll thank Him when I wake up on the
other side of Jordan.â€

Next day he was much more cheerful, and read the life of Stonewall
Jackson much of the time. I went out to dinner with a mining engineer I
had got to see on business, and came back about half-past ten in time
for our game of chess before turning in.

I had a cigar in my mouth, I remember, as I pushed open the
smoking-room door. The lights were not lit, which struck me as odd. I
wondered if Scudder had turned in already.

I snapped the switch, but there was nobody there. Then I saw something
in the far corner which made me drop my cigar and fall into a cold
sweat.

My guest was lying sprawled on his back. There was a long knife through
his heart which skewered him to the floor.
