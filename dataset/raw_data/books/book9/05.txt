The Adventure of the Spectacled Roadman


I sat down on the very crest of the pass and took stock of my position.

Behind me was the road climbing through a long cleft in the hills,
which was the upper glen of some notable river. In front was a flat
space of maybe a mile, all pitted with bog-holes and rough with
tussocks, and then beyond it the road fell steeply down another glen to
a plain whose blue dimness melted into the distance. To left and right
were round-shouldered green hills as smooth as pancakes, but to the
southâ€”that is, the left handâ€”there was a glimpse of high heathery
mountains, which I remembered from the map as the big knot of hill
which I had chosen for my sanctuary. I was on the central boss of a
huge upland country, and could see everything moving for miles. In the
meadows below the road half a mile back a cottage smoked, but it was
the only sign of human life. Otherwise there was only the calling of
plovers and the tinkling of little streams.

It was now about seven oâ€™clock, and as I waited I heard once again that
ominous beat in the air. Then I realized that my vantage-ground might
be in reality a trap. There was no cover for a tomtit in those bald
green places.

I sat quite still and hopeless while the beat grew louder. Then I saw
an aeroplane coming up from the east. It was flying high, but as I
looked it dropped several hundred feet and began to circle round the
knot of hill in narrowing circles, just as a hawk wheels before it
pounces. Now it was flying very low, and now the observer on board
caught sight of me. I could see one of the two occupants examining me
through glasses.

Suddenly it began to rise in swift whorls, and the next I knew it was
speeding eastward again till it became a speck in the blue morning.

That made me do some savage thinking. My enemies had located me, and
the next thing would be a cordon round me. I didnâ€™t know what force
they could command, but I was certain it would be sufficient. The
aeroplane had seen my bicycle, and would conclude that I would try to
escape by the road. In that case there might be a chance on the moors
to the right or left. I wheeled the machine a hundred yards from the
highway, and plunged it into a moss-hole, where it sank among pond-weed
and water-buttercups. Then I climbed to a knoll which gave me a view of
the two valleys. Nothing was stirring on the long white ribbon that
threaded them.

I have said there was not cover in the whole place to hide a rat. As
the day advanced it was flooded with soft fresh light till it had the
fragrant sunniness of the South African veld. At other times I would
have liked the place, but now it seemed to suffocate me. The free
moorlands were prison walls, and the keen hill air was the breath of a
dungeon.

I tossed a coinâ€”heads right, tails leftâ€”and it fell heads, so I turned
to the north. In a little I came to the brow of the ridge which was the
containing wall of the pass. I saw the highroad for maybe ten miles,
and far down it something that was moving, and that I took to be a
motor-car. Beyond the ridge I looked on a rolling green moor, which
fell away into wooded glens.

Now my life on the veld has given me the eyes of a kite, and I can see
things for which most men need a telescope.... Away down the slope, a
couple of miles away, several men were advancing, like a row of beaters
at a shoot.

I dropped out of sight behind the sky-line. That way was shut to me,
and I must try the bigger hills to the south beyond the highway. The
car I had noticed was getting nearer, but it was still a long way off
with some very steep gradients before it. I ran hard, crouching low
except in the hollows, and as I ran I kept scanning the brow of the
hill before me. Was it imagination, or did I see figuresâ€”one, two,
perhaps moreâ€”moving in a glen beyond the stream?

If you are hemmed in on all sides in a patch of land there is only one
chance of escape. You must stay in the patch, and let your enemies
search it and not find you. That was good sense, but how on earth was I
to escape notice in that table-cloth of a place? I would have buried
myself to the neck in mud or lain below water or climbed the tallest
tree. But there was not a stick of wood, the bog-holes were little
puddles, the stream was a slender trickle. There was nothing but short
heather, and bare hill bent, and the white highway.



Then in a tiny bight of road, beside a heap of stones, I found the
roadman.

He had just arrived, and was wearily flinging down his hammer. He
looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned.

â€œConfoond the day I ever left the herdinâ€™!â€ he said, as if to the world
at large. â€œThere I was my ain maister. Now Iâ€™m a slave to the
Goavernment, tethered to the roadside, wiâ€™ sair een, and a back like a
suckle.â€

He took up the hammer, struck a stone, dropped the implement with an
oath, and put both hands to his ears. â€œMercy on me! My heidâ€™s
burstinâ€™!â€ he cried.

He was a wild figure, about my own size but much bent, with a weekâ€™s
beard on his chin, and a pair of big horn spectacles.

â€œI canna daeâ€™t,â€ he cried again. â€œThe Surveyor maun just report me. Iâ€™m
for my bed.â€

I asked him what was the trouble, though indeed that was clear enough.

â€œThe trouble is that Iâ€™m no sober. Last nicht my dochter Merran was
waddit, and they danced till fower in the byre. Me and some ither
chiels sat down to the drinkinâ€™, and here I am. Peety that I ever
lookit on the wine when it was red!â€

I agreed with him about bed.

â€œItâ€™s easy speakinâ€™,â€ he moaned. â€œBut I got a postcard yestreen sayinâ€™
that the new Road Surveyor would be round the day. Heâ€™ll come and heâ€™ll
no find me, or else heâ€™ll find me fou, and either way Iâ€™m a done man.
Iâ€™ll awaâ€™ back to my bed and say Iâ€™m no weel, but I doot thatâ€™ll no
help me, for they ken my kind oâ€™ no-weel-ness.â€

Then I had an inspiration. â€œDoes the new Surveyor know you?â€ I asked.

â€œNo him. Heâ€™s just been a week at the job. He rins about in a wee
motor-cawr, and wad speir the inside oot oâ€™ a whelk.â€

â€œWhereâ€™s your house?â€ I asked, and was directed by a wavering finger to
the cottage by the stream.

â€œWell, back to your bed,â€ I said, â€œand sleep in peace. Iâ€™ll take on
your job for a bit and see the Surveyor.â€

He stared at me blankly; then, as the notion dawned on his fuddled
brain, his face broke into the vacant drunkardâ€™s smile.

â€œYouâ€™re the billy,â€ he cried. â€œItâ€™ll be easy eneuch managed. Iâ€™ve
finished that bing oâ€™ stanes, so you needna chap ony mair this
forenoon. Just take the barry, and wheel eneuch metal frae yon quarry
doon the road to mak anither bing the morn. My nameâ€™s Alexander
Trummle, and Iâ€™ve been seeven year at the trade, and twenty afore that
herdinâ€™ on Leithen Water. My freens caâ€™ me Ecky, and whiles Specky, for
I wear glesses, being waik iâ€™ the sicht. Just you speak the Surveyor
fair, and caâ€™ him Sir, and heâ€™ll be fell pleased. Iâ€™ll be back or
midday.â€

I borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat; stripped off coat,
waistcoat, and collar, and gave him them to carry home; borrowed, too,
the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property. He indicated my
simple tasks, and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards. Bed
may have been his chief object, but I think there was also something
left in the foot of a bottle. I prayed that he might be safe under
cover before my friends arrived on the scene.

Then I set to work to dress for the part. I opened the collar of my
shirtâ€”it was a vulgar blue-and-white check such as ploughmen wearâ€”and
revealed a neck as brown as any tinkerâ€™s. I rolled up my sleeves, and
there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmithâ€™s, sunburnt and
rough with old scars. I got my boots and trouser-legs all white from
the dust of the road, and hitched up my trousers, tying them with
string below the knee. Then I set to work on my face. With a handful of
dust I made a water-mark round my neck, the place where Mr Turnbullâ€™s
Sunday ablutions might be expected to stop. I rubbed a good deal of
dirt also into the sunburn of my cheeks. A roadmanâ€™s eyes would no
doubt be a little inflamed, so I contrived to get some dust in both of
mine, and by dint of vigorous rubbing produced a bleary effect.

The sandwiches Sir Harry had given me had gone off with my coat, but
the roadmanâ€™s lunch, tied up in a red handkerchief, was at my disposal.
I ate with great relish several of the thick slabs of scone and cheese
and drank a little of the cold tea. In the handkerchief was a local
paper tied with string and addressed to Mr Turnbullâ€”obviously meant to
solace his midday leisure. I did up the bundle again, and put the paper
conspicuously beside it.

My boots did not satisfy me, but by dint of kicking among the stones I
reduced them to the granite-like surface which marks a roadmanâ€™s
footgear. Then I bit and scraped my finger-nails till the edges were
all cracked and uneven. The men I was matched against would miss no
detail. I broke one of the bootlaces and retied it in a clumsy knot,
and loosed the other so that my thick grey socks bulged over the
uppers. Still no sign of anything on the road. The motor I had observed
half an hour ago must have gone home.

My toilet complete, I took up the barrow and began my journeys to and
from the quarry a hundred yards off.

I remember an old scout in Rhodesia, who had done many queer things in
his day, once telling me that the secret of playing a part was to think
yourself into it. You could never keep it up, he said, unless you could
manage to convince yourself that you were _it_. So I shut off all other
thoughts and switched them on to the road-mending. I thought of the
little white cottage as my home, I recalled the years I had spent
herding on Leithen Water, I made my mind dwell lovingly on sleep in a
box-bed and a bottle of cheap whisky. Still nothing appeared on that
long white road.

Now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me. A heron
flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish, taking no
more notice of me than if I had been a milestone. On I went, trundling
my loads of stone, with the heavy step of the professional. Soon I grew
warm, and the dust on my face changed into solid and abiding grit. I
was already counting the hours till evening should put a limit to Mr
Turnbullâ€™s monotonous toil.

Suddenly a crisp voice spoke from the road, and looking up I saw a
little Ford two-seater, and a round-faced young man in a bowler hat.

â€œAre you Alexander Turnbull?â€ he asked. â€œI am the new County Road
Surveyor. You live at Blackhopefoot, and have charge of the section
from Laidlawbyres to the Riggs? Good! A fair bit of road, Turnbull, and
not badly engineered. A little soft about a mile off, and the edges
want cleaning. See you look after that. Good morning. Youâ€™ll know me
the next time you see me.â€

Clearly my get-up was good enough for the dreaded Surveyor. I went on
with my work, and as the morning grew towards noon I was cheered by a
little traffic. A bakerâ€™s van breasted the hill, and sold me a bag of
ginger biscuits which I stowed in my trouser-pockets against
emergencies. Then a herd passed with sheep, and disturbed me somewhat
by asking loudly, â€œWhat had become oâ€™ Specky?â€

â€œIn bed wiâ€™ the colic,â€ I replied, and the herd passed on....

Just about midday a big car stole down the hill, glided past and drew
up a hundred yards beyond. Its three occupants descended as if to
stretch their legs, and sauntered towards me.

Two of the men I had seen before from the window of the Galloway
innâ€”one lean, sharp, and dark, the other comfortable and smiling. The
third had the look of a countrymanâ€”a vet, perhaps, or a small farmer.
He was dressed in ill-cut knickerbockers, and the eye in his head was
as bright and wary as a henâ€™s.

â€œMorning,â€ said the last. â€œThatâ€™s a fine easy job oâ€™ yours.â€

I had not looked up on their approach, and now, when accosted, I slowly
and painfully straightened my back, after the manner of roadmen; spat
vigorously, after the manner of the low Scot; and regarded them
steadily before replying. I confronted three pairs of eyes that missed
nothing.

â€œThereâ€™s waur jobs and thereâ€™s better,â€ I said sententiously. â€œI wad
rather hae yours, sittinâ€™ aâ€™ day on your hinderlands on thae cushions.
Itâ€™s you and your muckle cawrs that wreck my roads! If we aâ€™ had oor
richts, ye sud be made to mend what ye break.â€

The bright-eyed man was looking at the newspaper lying beside
Turnbullâ€™s bundle.

â€œI see you get your papers in good time,â€ he said.

I glanced at it casually. â€œAye, in gude time. Seeinâ€™ that that paper
camâ€™ out last Setterday Iâ€™m just sax days late.â€

He picked it up, glanced at the superscription, and laid it down again.
One of the others had been looking at my boots, and a word in German
called the speakerâ€™s attention to them.

â€œYouâ€™ve a fine taste in boots,â€ he said. â€œThese were never made by a
country shoemaker.â€

â€œThey were not,â€ I said readily. â€œThey were made in London. I got them
frae the gentleman that was here last year for the shootinâ€™. What was
his name now?â€ And I scratched a forgetful head. Again the sleek one
spoke in German. â€œLet us get on,â€ he said. â€œThis fellow is all right.â€

They asked one last question.

â€œDid you see anyone pass early this morning? He might be on a bicycle
or he might be on foot.â€

I very nearly fell into the trap and told a story of a bicyclist
hurrying past in the grey dawn. But I had the sense to see my danger. I
pretended to consider very deeply.

â€œI wasna up very early,â€ I said. â€œYe see, my dochter was merrit last
nicht, and we keepit it up late. I opened the house door about seeven
and there was naebody on the road then. Since I cam up here there has
just been the baker and the Ruchill herd, besides you gentlemen.â€

One of them gave me a cigar, which I smelt gingerly and stuck in
Turnbullâ€™s bundle. They got into their car and were out of sight in
three minutes.

My heart leaped with an enormous relief, but I went on wheeling my
stones. It was as well, for ten minutes later the car returned, one of
the occupants waving a hand to me. Those gentry left nothing to chance.

I finished Turnbullâ€™s bread and cheese, and pretty soon I had finished
the stones. The next step was what puzzled me. I could not keep up this
roadmaking business for long. A merciful Providence had kept Mr
Turnbull indoors, but if he appeared on the scene there would be
trouble. I had a notion that the cordon was still tight round the glen,
and that if I walked in any direction I should meet with questioners.
But get out I must. No manâ€™s nerve could stand more than a day of being
spied on.

I stayed at my post till five oâ€™clock. By that time I had resolved to
go down to Turnbullâ€™s cottage at nightfall and take my chance of
getting over the hills in the darkness. But suddenly a new car came up
the road, and slowed down a yard or two from me. A fresh wind had
risen, and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette.

It was a touring car, with the tonneau full of an assortment of
baggage. One man sat in it, and by an amazing chance I knew him. His
name was Marmaduke Jopley, and he was an offence to creation. He was a
sort of blood stockbroker, who did his business by toadying eldest sons
and rich young peers and foolish old ladies. â€œMarmieâ€™ was a familiar
figure, I understood, at balls and polo-weeks and country houses. He
was an adroit scandal-monger, and would crawl a mile on his belly to
anything that had a title or a million. I had a business introduction
to his firm when I came to London, and he was good enough to ask me to
dinner at his club. There he showed off at a great rate, and pattered
about his duchesses till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick. I
asked a man afterwards why nobody kicked him, and was told that
Englishmen reverenced the weaker sex.

Anyhow there he was now, nattily dressed, in a fine new car, obviously
on his way to visit some of his smart friends. A sudden daftness took
me, and in a second I had jumped into the tonneau and had him by the
shoulder.

â€œHullo, Jopley,â€ I sang out. â€œWell met, my lad!â€ He got a horrid
fright. His chin dropped as he stared at me. â€œWho the devil are you?â€
he gasped.

â€œMy nameâ€™s Hannay,â€ I said. â€œFrom Rhodesia, you remember.â€

â€œGood God, the murderer!â€ he choked.

â€œJust so. And thereâ€™ll be a second murder, my dear, if you donâ€™t do as
I tell you. Give me that coat of yours. That cap, too.â€

He did as he was bid, for he was blind with terror. Over my dirty
trousers and vulgar shirt I put on his smart driving-coat, which
buttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my collar.
I stuck the cap on my head, and added his gloves to my get-up. The
dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one of the neatest
motorists in Scotland. On Mr Jopleyâ€™s head I clapped Turnbullâ€™s
unspeakable hat, and told him to keep it there.

Then with some difficulty I turned the car. My plan was to go back the
road he had come, for the watchers, having seen it before, would
probably let it pass unremarked, and Marmieâ€™s figure was in no way like
mine.

â€œNow, my child,â€ I said, â€œsit quite still and be a good boy. I mean you
no harm. Iâ€™m only borrowing your car for an hour or two. But if you
play me any tricks, and above all if you open your mouth, as sure as
thereâ€™s a God above me Iâ€™ll wring your neck. _Savez?_â€

I enjoyed that eveningâ€™s ride. We ran eight miles down the valley,
through a village or two, and I could not help noticing several
strange-looking folk lounging by the roadside. These were the watchers
who would have had much to say to me if I had come in other garb or
company. As it was, they looked incuriously on. One touched his cap in
salute, and I responded graciously.

As the dark fell I turned up a side glen which, as I remember from the
map, led into an unfrequented corner of the hills. Soon the villages
were left behind, then the farms, and then even the wayside cottage.
Presently we came to a lonely moor where the night was blackening the
sunset gleam in the bog pools. Here we stopped, and I obligingly
reversed the car and restored to Mr Jopley his belongings.

â€œA thousand thanks,â€ I said. â€œThereâ€™s more use in you than I thought.
Now be off and find the police.â€

As I sat on the hillside, watching the tail-light dwindle, I reflected
on the various kinds of crime I had now sampled. Contrary to general
belief, I was not a murderer, but I had become an unholy liar, a
shameless impostor, and a highwayman with a marked taste for expensive
motor-cars.
